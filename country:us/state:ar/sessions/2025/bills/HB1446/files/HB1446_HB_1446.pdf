11 SECTION 7. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
12 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the Arkansas Constitution,
13 Article 19, § 14 was amended by Issue 1 of 2024 to allow state lottery
14 proceeds to fund vocational or technical school scholarships for Arkansans;
15 that there are workforce needs within the state, and the current law needs to
16 be amended immediately in order to effectuate this change voted for by the
17 people that would allow Arkansans to benefit from this change in the use of
18 lottery proceeds; and that this act is immediately necessary because the
19 process and procedures to distribute these scholarships need to be updated as
20 quickly as possible in order to provide scholarship funding for Arkansans
21 that would allow them to receive training and join the workforce of the
22 state. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being
23 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and
24 safety shall become effective on:
25 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
26 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
27 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
28 bill; or
29 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
30 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
