36 (2) The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution
56 03-12-2025 14:09:05 CRH173
As Engrossed: S3/6/25 S3/12/25 SB246
1 provides that no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the
2 equal protection of the law;
3 (3) Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 promotes the
4 desegregation of public schools and authorizes the United States Attorney

6 1964. It defines "desegregation" as "the assignment of students to public
7 schools and within such schools without regard to their race, color,
8 religion, or national origin," thereby removing government-sanctioned racial
9 discrimination in schools and implementing the United States Supreme Court’s
10 holding in "Brown v. Board of Education", 347 U.S. 483 (1954), that racial
11 separation is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
12 Amendment; and
13 (4) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that “No
14 person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national
15 origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
16 subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal
17 financial assistance".
