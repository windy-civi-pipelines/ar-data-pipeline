29 REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES. The Department of Agriculture provides a wide
30 range of services to all Arkansans. The specific service needs, along with
31 staffing required to meet them, can vary significantly due to factors such as
32 natural disasters, changing federal mandates, and job market variations like
33 wildland firefighters, dispatchers, foresters, engineers, and
34 microbiologists' shortages. These factors make it challenging for the
35 Department to accurately predict the exact needs for positions across its
36 different appropriations throughout any fiscal year. To respond swiftly to

6 Council or the Joint Budget Committee, if meeting in Legislative Session, may

10 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of

16 determined that the Department of Agriculture may operate more efficiently if
17 some flexibility is provided to the Department of Agriculture authorizing
18 broad powers under the Reallocation of Resources provisions herein.

24 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in

28 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
29 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
30 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
