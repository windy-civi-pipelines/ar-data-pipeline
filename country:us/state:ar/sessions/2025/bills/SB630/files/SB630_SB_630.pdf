24 (1) The jury shall first hear all evidence relevant to every
25 charge on which a defendant is being tried and shall retire to reach a
26 verdict on each charge;
27 (2)(A) If the defendant is found guilty of one (1) or more
28 charges, the jury shall then hear additional evidence relevant to sentencing
29 on those charges. Evidence introduced in the guilt phase may be considered,

9 that counsel may argue as to alternative sentences for which the defendant

11 alternative sentence. However, this recommendation shall not be binding on
12 the court;
13 (5) After a jury finds guilt, the defendant, with the agreement
14 of the prosecution and the consent of the court, may waive jury sentencing,
15 in which case the court shall impose sentence; and
16 (6) After a plea of guilty, the defendant, with the agreement of
17 the prosecution and the consent of the court, may shall be sentenced by a
18 jury impaneled for purposes of sentencing only the court.

24 sentencing for similar offenses;
25 (C) Cost of incarceration; and
26 (D) Opportunity to address sentencing in a coordinated
