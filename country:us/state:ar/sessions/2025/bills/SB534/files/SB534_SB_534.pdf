*JMB567*

SB534
1 of the kratom plant, as Schedule I substances;
2 (2) The Department of Health justified this action on the basis
3 that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine induce opioid-like effects when
4 consumed and included kratom as a Schedule I substance since it has no
5 approved medical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration;
6 (3)(A) The United States Food and Drug Administration had
7 encouraged every state to ban kratom on the premise that it would be
8 scheduled by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration as a
9 controlled substance in 2016 and that Alabama, Wisconsin, Indiana, and
10 Vermont had already classified kratom as a Schedule I substance.
11 (B) Rhode Island also banned kratom in 2017 based on
12 information provided by the United State Food and Drug Administration;
13 (4) On October 13, 2016, the United States Drug Enforcement
14 Administration withdrew the United States Drug Enforcement Administration’s
15 scheduling recommendation for kratom, citing insufficient evidence to meet
16 the requirements for classifying mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as
17 Schedule I substances;
18 (5) On August 16, 2018, the Assistant Secretary of Health of the
19 United States Department of Health and Human Services withdrew the United
20 States Food and Drug Administration’s second scheduling recommendation for
21 mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as Schedule I substances citing
22 “disappointingly poor evidence and data and a failure to consider overall
23 public health”;
24 (6) On December 1, 2021, the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence
25 at the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs rejected the
26 recommendation for international scheduling of mitragynine and 7-
27 hydroxymitragynine citing insufficient evidence to support that action;
28 (7) On February 21, 2023, the Indiana House of Representatives,
29 on a vote of 53-40, passed a repeal of the kratom ban and replaced it with
30 the Kratom Consumer Protection Act;
31 (8)(A) On March 1, 2023, the Vermont Department of Health
32 accepted a petition by the American Kratom Association to remove the kratom
33 ban.
34 (B) Upon completion of the planned rulemaking of the
35 Vermont Department of Health, the number of states with a kratom ban has been
36 reduced to five (5) states;

SB534
1 (9) On March 10, 2023, the Wisconsin Controlled Substances Board
2 passed a motion affirming to the Wisconsin State Legislature that kratom does
3 not meet the statutorily-mandated eight factors established by the Controlled
4 Substances Act for scheduling despite their view kratom should not be removed
5 from scheduling until more research is available;
6 (10) The Rhode Island Legislature is proceeding with the Kratom
7 Consumer Protection Act after the Interim Director of the Rhode Island
8 Department of Health acknowledged kratom does not meet the criteria for
9 scheduling;
10 (11) At this time, nine (9) states, including Utah, Georgia,
11 Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Colorado, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Virginia,
12 have passed versions of the Kratom Consumer Protection Act;
13 (12) On March 16, 2022, United States Department of Health and
14 Human Services Secretary Becerra, in a letter to Senator Mike Lee and
15 Representative Mark Pocan, acknowledged “knowledge gaps” on kratom and that
16 “kratom-involved overdose deaths have occurred after use of adulterated
17 kratom products or taking kratom with other substances”;
18 (13) On December 29, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the FY23
19 Omnibus with kratom report language commending the National Institute on Drug
20 Abuse for funding studies on kratom that “may provide help for some Americans
21 struggling with addictions, given its analgesic and less addictive properties
22 as compared to opioids”;
23 (14)(A) Data from the Department of Health shows that fatal
24 opioid overdoses have been on the rise in recent years.
25 (B) In 2021, the Department of Health reported there were
26 six hundred twenty-eight (628) drug overdose deaths in Arkansas; and
27 (15)(A) On May 17, 2022, the Director of the National Institute
28 on Drug Abuse, Dr. Nora Volkow, testified regarding the drug overdose crisis
29 at a hearing of the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on
30 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.
31 (B) When asked about overdose prevention strategies, Dr.
32 Volkow stated: “There’s also interest in the community to test other products
33 that may serve as harm reduction. For example, the use of kratom, which is
34 sold as tea and that contains a drug molecule that has effects that are
35 similar to a dose of buprenorphine but could be utilized also for decreasing
36 withdrawal or depression.”
