33 PROMOTIONAL ITEMS. The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall establish

SB27
1 appropriation and funds to the promotional items line, the request shall be
2 forwarded by the Minority Health Commission to the Chief Fiscal Officer of
3 the State for processing and for prior approval by the Arkansas Legislative
4 Council or Joint Budget Committee. Determining the maximum number of
5 employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue funding
6 for a state agency each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General
7 Assembly. This is usually accomplished by delineating such maximums in the
8 appropriation act(s) for a state agency and the general revenue allocations
9 authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue
10 Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the
11 Minority Health Commission may operate more efficiently if some flexibility
12 is provided to the Minority Health Commission authorizing broad powers under
13 this Section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the
14 General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the
15 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this section.
16 The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
17 Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of
18 approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled
19 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is
20 void.
21 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1,2024
22 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
23
24 SECTION 5. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
25 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
26 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
27 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
28 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
29 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
30 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
31 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
32 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
33
34 SECTION 6. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
35 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
36 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
3 01/06/2025 3:27:13 PM MAH007

1 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
2 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
3 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
4 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
5 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
6
7 SECTION 7. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
8 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
9 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
10 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
11 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
12 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
13 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
14 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
15 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
16 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
17 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
