23 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
24 The General Assembly finds that:
25 (1) Under the Arkansas Constitution, the General Assembly must
26 provide funding for an adequate and equitable education for every child in
27 the State of Arkansas;
28 (2) To provide an adequate and equitable education for every
29 child in the state, the General Assembly should adopt the recommendations
30 presented by the House Committee on Education and Senate Committee on
31 Education in the 2024 Educational Adequacy Study final report for funding
32 public schools in the upcoming biennium, except in the areas of special
33 education, staff pay, and mental health;

35 foundation funding to categorical funding;

HB1539
1 the 2024 Educational Adequacy Study, with seventy-two percent (72%) of
2 superintendents reporting that their school districts are in moderate or
3 extreme need of more funding for special education teachers;
4 (5) Special education funds are currently allocated by the
5 number of students in a school district rather than the number of students
6 with special needs in a school district, leading to a mismatch of funds;
7 (6) Special education funds are part of foundation funding,
8 meaning they do not currently have to be spent on special education, but if
9 they were categorical funds, they would have to be spent on only special
10 education;
11 (7) Public school classified staff members should get a real
12 raise;
13 (8) Public school classified staff members are vital members of
14 a learning community and are often underpaid;
15 (9) Inadequate pay for public school classified staff members
16 negatively impacts a public school district's ability to recruit and retain
17 quality public school classified staff members, which negatively impacts the
18 student experience, school morale, and educational outcomes;
19 (10)(A) In 2023, the General Assembly approved foundation
20 funding, including what the biennial matrix called a “$2 salary increase”,
21 for public school classified staff members.
22 (B) Despite approving a salary increase, there was enough
23 money allocated for only five and four-tenths (5.4) full-time equivalent
24 classified staff members per five hundred (500) students, whereas there are
25 actually twenty-nine and eight-tenths (29.8) full-time equivalent public
26 school classified staff members per five hundred (500) students in Arkansas
27 public schools, meaning that the “$2 salary increase” was only a 30 cents
28 (30¢) per hour raise when spread among all full-time public school equivalent
29 classified staff members;
30 (11) The state should not only deliver on its previous promise
31 of funding a two dollars ($2.00) per hour raise for public school classified
32 staff members, but should catch up with inflation and deliver a four dollars
33 ($4.00) per hour raise for public school classified staff members, ensuring
34 that the funding is there to pay every public school classified staff member
35 at least fifteen dollars ($15.00) per hour;
36 (12) Funding should be added for more counselors and social

1 workers in public schools;
2 (13) Mental health is a statewide crisis, especially among
3 youth;
4 (14) Public school counselors perform many functions that
5 directly and indirectly impact youth mental health, but due to limited public
6 school district funds and a statewide counselor shortage, public school
7 counselors are often overworked and asked to perform functions outside their
8 intended responsibilities; and
9 (15) The state should provide sufficient funding for either two
10 (2) counselors per five hundred (500) students or one (1) counselor and one
11 (1) social worker per five hundred (500) students to improve counselor
12 working conditions and student outcomes.
