28 SECTION 7. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
29 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
30 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
31 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
32 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
33 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
34 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
35 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
36 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
8 01/27/2025 12:28:26 PM HAR015

SB113
1 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
