6 03-17-2025 10:17:16 TNL239
As Engrossed: H3/10/25 S3/17/25 HB1633

2 be increasingly difficult for the public schools to appropriately plan and
3 accommodate student needs for the upcoming school year; that both schools and
4 students need time to determine participation in and eligibility for
5 extracurricular activities, particularly for athletic activities; and that
6 this act is immediately necessary to give students time to assess school
7 choice options and select the school that best fits their needs while also
8 providing public schools with enough time to appropriately plan and budget
9 for the upcoming school year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist,
10 and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public
11 peace, health, and safety shall become effective on:
12 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
13 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,

15 bill; or
16 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
17 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.

32 SECTION 7. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
33 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that student transfers from public

As Engrossed: H3/10/25 S3/17/25 HB1633
1 if public schools face unexpected student transfers in large numbers, it will
2 be increasingly difficult for the public schools to appropriately plan and
3 accommodate student needs for the upcoming school year; that both schools and
4 students need time to determine participation in and eligibility for
5 extracurricular activities, particularly for athletic activities; and that
6 this act is immediately necessary to give students time to assess school
7 choice options and select the school that best fits their needs while also
8 providing public schools with enough time to appropriately plan and budget
9 for the upcoming school year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist,
10 and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public
11 peace, health, and safety shall become effective on:
12 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
13 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
14 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
15 bill; or
16 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
17 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
