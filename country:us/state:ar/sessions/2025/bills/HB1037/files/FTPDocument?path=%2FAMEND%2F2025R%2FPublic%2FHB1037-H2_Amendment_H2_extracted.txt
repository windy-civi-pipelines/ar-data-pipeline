(a) The General Assembly finds that:
(1) Arkansas ranks forty-ninth (49th) among states in voter
registration and forty-eighth (48th) among states in voter turnout;
(2) High voter turnout helps ensure that the will of the people
will be respected by government, confers legitimacy on government,
strengthens popular trust in government, and enforces government
accountability;
(3) The voting age is fixed by the United States Constitution at
eighteen (18) years of age;
(4) Twenty-eight (28) other states allow preregistration, in
which a person may register before eighteen (18) years of age but not vote
until eighteen (18) years of age;
(5) Research shows preregistration to have positive and
significant effects on voter turnout; and
(6) Research shows preregistration to be equally effective for
Republican and Democratic registrants.
(b) It is the intent of this act to allow preregistration for persons
seventeen (17) years of age before reaching eighteen (18) years of age.
