23 SECTION 4. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
24 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
25 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
26 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
27 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
28 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
29 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
30 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
31 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
32 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
33 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
