25 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
26
27 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code § 6-18-227 is repealed.
28 6-18-227. Arkansas Opportunity Public School Choice Act — Definitions.
29 (a)(1) This section may be referred to and cited as the “Arkansas
30 Opportunity Public School Choice Act”.
31 (2)(A) The purpose of this section is to provide enhanced
32 opportunity for students in this state to gain the knowledge and skills
33 necessary for postsecondary education, a technical education, or the world of
34 work.
35 (B) The General Assembly:
36 (i) Recognizes that the Arkansas Constitution, as
*TNL294*
03/17/2025 3:41:00 PM TNL294
SB482
1 interpreted by the Supreme Court in Lake View School District No. 25 v.
2 Huckabee, 351 Ark. 31 (2002), makes education a paramount duty of the state;
3 (ii) Finds that the Arkansas Constitution requires
4 the state to provide an adequate education;
5 (iii) Further finds that a student should not be
6 compelled against the wishes of the parent, guardian, or the student, if the
7 student is eighteen (18) years of age or older, to remain in a public school
8 district classified by the State Board of Education as a school district in
9 need of Level 5 — Intensive support under § 6-15-2913 or § 6-15-2915 or a
10 public school that has a rating of “F” under §§ 6-15-2105 and 6-15-2106 and
11 state board rules; and
12 (iv) Shall make available a public school choice
13 option in order to give a student the opportunity to attend a public school
14 or school district not in need of Level 5 — Intensive support under § 6-15-
15 2913 or §6-15-2915 or that does not have a rating of “F” under §§ 6-15-2105
16 and 6-15-2106 and state board rules.
17 (3) The General Assembly further finds that giving more options
18 to parents and students with respect to where the students attend public
19 school will increase the responsiveness and effectiveness of the state's
20 schools, since teachers, administrators, and school district board members
21 will have added incentives to satisfy the educational needs of the students
22 who reside in the district.
23 (4) A public school choice program is hereby established to
24 enable a student to transfer, subject to the restrictions in this section,
25 from a:

21 BETWEEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL
22 DISTRICTS; AND TO AMEND THE PUBLIC
23 SCHOOL CHOICE ACT OF 2015.
24
25 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
26
27 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code § 6-18-227 is repealed.
28 6-18-227. Arkansas Opportunity Public School Choice Act — Definitions.
29 (a)(1) This section may be referred to and cited as the “Arkansas
30 Opportunity Public School Choice Act”.
31 (2)(A) The purpose of this section is to provide enhanced
32 opportunity for students in this state to gain the knowledge and skills
33 necessary for postsecondary education, a technical education, or the world of
34 work.
35 (B) The General Assembly:
36 (i) Recognizes that the Arkansas Constitution, as
*TNL294*
03/17/2025 3:41:00 PM TNL294

SB482
1 interpreted by the Supreme Court in Lake View School District No. 25 v.
2 Huckabee, 351 Ark. 31 (2002), makes education a paramount duty of the state;
3 (ii) Finds that the Arkansas Constitution requires
4 the state to provide an adequate education;
5 (iii) Further finds that a student should not be
6 compelled against the wishes of the parent, guardian, or the student, if the
7 student is eighteen (18) years of age or older, to remain in a public school
8 district classified by the State Board of Education as a school district in
9 need of Level 5 — Intensive support under § 6-15-2913 or § 6-15-2915 or a
10 public school that has a rating of “F” under §§ 6-15-2105 and 6-15-2106 and
11 state board rules; and
12 (iv) Shall make available a public school choice
13 option in order to give a student the opportunity to attend a public school
14 or school district not in need of Level 5 — Intensive support under § 6-15-
15 2913 or §6-15-2915 or that does not have a rating of “F” under §§ 6-15-2105
16 and 6-15-2106 and state board rules.
17 (3) The General Assembly further finds that giving more options
18 to parents and students with respect to where the students attend public
19 school will increase the responsiveness and effectiveness of the state's
20 schools, since teachers, administrators, and school district board members
21 will have added incentives to satisfy the educational needs of the students
22 who reside in the district.
23 (4) A public school choice program is hereby established to
24 enable a student to transfer, subject to the restrictions in this section,
25 from a:
26 (A) Public school district that is classified by the state
27 board as a public school district in need of Level 5 — Intensive support
28 under § 6-15-2913 or §6-15-2915 to another public school district in the
29 state that is not classified as in need of Level 5 — Intensive support under
30 § 6-15-2913 or §6-15-2915; or
31 (B) Public school that has a rating of “F” under §§ 6-15-
32 2105 and 6-15-2106 and state board rules to a public school that does not
33 have a rating of “F” under §§ 6-15-2105 and 6-15-2106 and state board rules.
34 (b)(1) Upon the request of a parent, guardian, or student, if the
35 student is eighteen (18) years of age or older, a student may transfer from
36 his or her resident district or public school to another school district or
