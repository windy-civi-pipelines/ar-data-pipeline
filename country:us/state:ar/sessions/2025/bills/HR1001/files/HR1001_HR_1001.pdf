21 SECTION 1. The Rules of the House of Representatives of the Ninety-
22 Fifth General Assembly of the State of Arkansas are adopted to read as
23 follows:
24
25 MEMBERS
26 1. Every representative shall be present within the House during the
27 session of the House and every member shall be present at each committee
28 meeting of which he or she is a member, unless excused or necessarily
29 prevented. It is the policy of the Arkansas General Assembly, as a term-
30 limited body, to encourage legislators to learn as much as possible by
31 attending meetings of committees of which they are not a member. Prior
32 signed and documented approval must be obtained from the chairperson of a
33 committee for a visiting non-committee member to enjoy certain privileges
34 offered to regular members.
35 2. For the purpose of seating in the House Chamber for an upcoming
36 regular session of the General Assembly, the Speaker of the House, following
*JET019*

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HR1001
1 the November General Election, shall declare all House Chamber seats vacant
2 and representatives and representatives-elect must select in the order of
3 their seniority any seat not occupied after notification by the Chief Clerk
4 of available seats. Absence or failure to select a seat at the assigned
5 selection time will automatically allow the Speaker to assign the member to
6 his or her same seat if it is available or the member or member-elect to a
7 seat selected by the Speaker. The Chief Clerk shall furnish voting machine
8 and desk keys.
9 3. When it is necessary for seniority of incoming members to be
10 determined by lot, the Speaker of the House and the Speaker-designate of the
11 House shall conduct a drawing by lots upon receiving certification from the
12 Secretary of State of the election of membership to each General Assembly.
13 Qualified and certified persons to be seated and officially receive the oath
14 of office may do so only at a time and place prescribed by the House. No
15 person having resigned from public office as a provision to a plea agreement
16 to avoid felony prosecution shall be seated or administered the oath of
17 office. Incoming members with previous legislative tenure shall be placed
18 highest in seniority among the incoming members based upon previous terms of
19 service. Where an equivalence of full terms of service exists, seniority for
20 those with equal terms shall be asserted by drawing lots to determine their
21 numerical standing.
22 4. A majority of all representatives elected to the House shall be
23 necessary to transact business. When less than a quorum of House members
24 shall assemble, those present shall be authorized to send for the absent
25 representatives or adjourn. Penalties may be decided by a majority of the
26 representatives present. (Arkansas Constitution, Article 5, § 11)
27 5. Each representative is expected to vote on each question put before
28 the House unless he or she has an immediate personal interest.
29 6. Any representative shall have the right to explain his/her vote on
30 any bill or other question before the House, in writing. Such explanation
31 shall not be entered upon the Journal, but shall be filed with the Chief
32 Clerk.
33 7. Every bill or resolution in the possession of the House or of any
34 committee thereof shall be made available to any member for his/her
35 examination.
36 8. No member at any time shall take from the House or any committee

28 scheduled election. Leave for absence shall be requested immediately before
29 the time of the election. The Speaker shall announce the name and number of

24 PARLIAMENTARY PRACTICE
25 19. When a question is under debate, motions shall have precedence in
26 the following order (the request for a quorum call is always in order; the
27 Chairperson is not compelled to accept any motion):
28 19.(a) To fix the time to which the House will adjourn (non-debatable)
29 (majority of a quorum);
30 19.(a)(1) (A majority of a quorum is a majority of those voting when
31 at least a majority of the members are present and voting;)
32 19.(b) To adjourn (non-debatable) (majority of a quorum);
33 19.(c) To take a recess (non-debatable) (majority of a quorum);
34 19.(d) Postpone temporarily; lay on the table (non-debatable)
35 (majority of a quorum) To take from the table (non-debatable) (majority of a
36 quorum) (when the motion to take from the table is adopted, the proposition
8 01-16-2025 14:00:54 JET019

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HR1001
1 takes the same position it held when the motion to lay on the table was
2 adopted);
3 19.(e) Immediate consideration (non-debatable) (2/3 of a quorum);
4 19.(f) Previous question (non-debatable) (5 seconds) (majority of a
5 quorum);
6 19.(g) Limit or extend debate (non-debatable) (2/3 of a quorum);
7 19.(h) To expunge (debatable) (2/3 of membership) (67);
8 19.(i) Postpone to a day certain (debatable) (majority of a quorum);
9 19.(j) Committee of the Whole, go into (non-debatable) (majority of a
10 quorum);
11 19.(k) Refer (debatable) (majority of a quorum);
12 19.(l) Amend (debatable) (majority of a quorum);
13 19.(m) Postpone indefinitely (debatable) (majority of membership);
14 19.(n) Take out of proper order (non-debatable) (2/3 of a quorum);
15 19.(o) Special order of business (debatable) (2/3 of a quorum); and
16 19.(p) To suspend the rules (non-debatable) (2/3 of a quorum).
17 20. A motion to adjourn shall always be in order, when the Floor can
18 be obtained for that purpose, except when the previous question has been
19 ordered.
20 21. The motion to recess, when the Floor can be obtained for that
21 purpose, must specify the time which shall elapse and the time for
22 reconvening. It may be amended to alter specific time.
23 22. Previous question:
24 22.(a) When any debatable question is before the House, any member may
25 move the previous question. It shall be seconded by five (5) members whether
26 the question shall be stated. When the previous question shall have been
27 adopted, the proponents shall be allowed fifteen (15) minutes in which to
28 debate it, and the opponents of the main question shall be allowed fifteen
29 (15) minutes, after which time a vote upon the main question shall be taken.
30 22.(b) Pending a vote on the main question, one (1) motion to refer is
31 permitted. A motion to refer under this rule applies to House resolutions as
32 well as to House bills, to Senate bills and to Senate amendments to a House
33 bill, and to a motion to amend the Journal. The motion to refer under this
34 rule is non-debatable and may not be laid upon the table.
35 23. A motion to postpone to a day certain may not specify the hour; a
36 special order is necessary to specify the hour; the motion may be amended and
9 01-16-2025 14:00:54 JET019

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HR1001
1 it is debatable within narrow limits only, confined to the merit of the
2 motion itself.
3 24. The simple motion to refer is debatable within its narrow limits,
4 but the merits of the proposition to which it is proposed to refer may not be
5 brought into the debate. The motion to refer with instructions is debatable
6 (majority vote of a quorum). When a question is raised about the proper
7 referral of a bill to committee, if the Speaker admits error in the referral
8 of the bill to a committee, the bill may be re-referred by a majority vote of
9 a quorum; however, if the Speaker does not admit error in the referral of the
10 bill to committee, the bill may only be re-referred by a two-thirds (2/3)
11 vote of a quorum. When a bill is re-referred to a committee, any previous
12 committee recommendation is automatically stripped from the bill.
13 24.(a) When a motion is under consideration, only two (2) substitutes
14 to that motion shall be in order. Only a motion applicable to the main
15 motion and of a higher precedence upon recognition may be substituted for the
16 motion under consideration. A substitute to the third degree shall not be in
17 order. Unless specified otherwise by the presenter of the motion at the time
18 the motion is made, a substitute motion shall apply to the main motion.
19 25. The motion to postpone indefinitely opens to debate all the merits
20 of the proposition to which it is applied. It may not be applied to the
21 motion to refer, or to suspend the rules, or to motions relating to the order
22 of business.
23 25.(a) The motion for indefinite postponement and possible
24 consideration by a joint interim committee shall be as follows: "Mr. Speaker,
25 I move that consideration of _______ be postponed indefinitely and that
26 consideration be given by the joint interim committee on _______ for a study
27 of ______." (majority of membership).
28 26. The motion to limit or extend debate must specify time
29 limitations. A substitute motion specifying a lesser time may be accepted.
30 27. Reconsideration:
31 27.(a) When a proposition has been made and carried or lost, it shall
32 be in order for any member of the majority on the same or succeeding
33 legislative day to move for the reconsideration thereof, or give notice of
34 his or her intentions to do so and such motion shall take precedence over
35 other questions except consideration of a conference report or a motion to
36 adjourn: Provided, the motion or proposition shall only be considered during
10 01-16-2025 14:00:54 JET019

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HR1001
1 the period reserved for regular bills. The notice shall not be withdrawn
2 after the said succeeding legislative day without the consent of the House,
3 and thereafter any member may call it up for consideration: Provided, the
4 notice to reconsider must be disposed of within three (3) legislative days
5 following the day the vote was taken; provided, that such notice to
6 reconsider cannot be given after the 57th day of a regular session or during
7 a special session or fiscal session during which times a motion to reconsider
8 must be disposed of immediately.
9 27.(b) The provisions of the rule that the motion may be made “by any
10 member of the majority” is construed, in case of a tie, to mean the member of
11 the prevailing side, and the same construction applies in the case of a two-
12 thirds (2/3) vote. Where the yeas and nays have not been ordered recorded in
13 the Journal, any member, irrespective of whether he or she voted with the
14 majority or not, may make the motion to reconsider or give notice thereof;
15 but a member who was absent or who was paired in favor of the majority
16 contention and did not vote may not make a motion.
17 27.(c) A bill in the possession of the House is not considered passed
18 or an amendment agreed to if a motion to reconsider is pending; the effect of
19 the motion being to suspend the original proposition. A notice or motion to
20 reconsider shall not be allowed unless the bill is in the House. A bill
21 shall not leave the House once notice of reconsideration is given. When the
22 motion to reconsider is decided in the affirmative, the question immediately
23 recurs on the motion reconsidered. However, prior to consideration of the
24 question at hand, the Speaker shall have the title, expressing the main
25 contents of the proposition being reconsidered, read to the House. When the
26 motion to reconsider is defeated, a second motion to reconsider may not be
27 made.
28 27.(d) The motion to reconsider is agreed to by a majority of a
29 quorum, even though the vote reconsidered requires a majority or more of the
30 membership. Upon reconsideration when a proposition has been voted twice and
31 either carried or lost it is considered "Clinched".
32 27.(e) A notice to reconsider is not debatable. A motion to
33 reconsider is debatable when the item to which it applies is debatable.
34 27.(f) No bill, petition, memorial, or resolution referred to a
35 committee or reported there-from for recommitment shall be brought back into
36 the House on a motion to reconsider.

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HR1001
1 27.(g) The "Clincher” motion is two (2) motions in one (1); it is a
2 motion to reconsider and to lay on the table. Having prevailed, the
3 proposition shall not be again considered except by expunging the record.
4 The "Clincher" motion is adopted by a majority of the membership. The
5 Speaker shall accept a "Sound the Ballot" request after the "Clincher" has
6 been adopted and before the next order of business is called.
7 27.(h) No “Clincher” motion shall be entertained on a bill passed
8 during the morning hour or which has been represented to be non-controversial
9 regardless of when passed. Prior to the 60th day of a session, no bill
10 passed during the morning hour, or a bill appearing on the non-controversial
11 bill calendar which has passed, shall be transmitted to the Senate until the
12 expiration of the morning hour of the day next following its passage in which
13 the House is in session.
14 28. No dilatory motion shall be entertained by the Speaker.
15 29. Two-thirds (2/3) of a quorum may suspend the rules, other than
16 rules that require a two-thirds (2/3) or three-fourths (3/4) vote of the
17 membership. Rule 12 of the Joint Rules of the Senate and House of
18 Representatives - Suspension of Joint Rules
19 30. No standing rule or order shall be revised without one (1) day’s
20 notice being given thereof.
21 31. In every case not provided for in the House rules, the Speaker,
22 the Parliamentarian, and the members shall be guided by Mason’s Manual of
23 Legislative Procedure. Each member of the Rules Committee may be furnished a
24 copy of the current edition and of each new or revised edition of Mason’s
25 Manual of Legislative Procedure and additional copies may be available to
26 other members from the Parliamentarian, upon approval of the Rules Committee.

13 three recommendations: “do pass”, “do pass as amended”, or “do not pass”. If

2 18) (House Rule 24 part) When a question is raised about the proper
3 referral of a bill or resolution to committee, if the Speaker admits error in
4 the referral of the bill or resolution to a committee, the bill or resolution
5 may be re-referred by a majority vote of a quorum; however, if the Speaker
6 does not admit error in the referral of the bill or resolution to committee,
7 the bill or resolution may only be re-referred by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of
8 a quorum. When a bill or resolution is re-referred to a committee, any
9 previous committee recommendation is automatically stripped from the bill or
10 resolution. When a motion is under consideration, only two (2) substitutes
11 to that motion shall be in order. Only a motion applicable to the main
12 motion and of a higher precedence upon recognition may be substituted for the
13 motion under consideration. A substitute to the third degree shall not be in
14 order. Unless specified otherwise by the presenter of the motion at the time
15 the motion is made, a substitute motion shall apply to the main motion.
16
17 19) (House Rule 55 (a)) House Committee Staff will automatically and
18 without delay place all bills or resolutions referred to the committees on
19 the committee agendas. Staff will notify the sponsor of bills or resolutions
20 assigned to committee. Referred bills shall be placed on the committee’s
21 active agenda in the order they are read across the desk on the House Floor.
22 A bill shall not be placed on a committee agenda until the second calendar
23 day following the initial filing of the bill. When an active agenda is
24 established in a committee and bills from that agenda are not placed on the
25 deferred list and if the bills are passed over, they are placed at the bottom
26 of the list of the day’s active agenda.
27
28 20) After a bill or resolution has appeared on the committee agenda and has
29 been called up for consideration by the committee and the sponsor of the bill
30 or resolution or a representative is not present to present the bill or
31 resolution, the bill or resolution will be placed on the active agenda two
32 (2) additional times, but will be placed at the bottom of the active agenda.
33
34 21) The sponsor may request a bill or resolution be moved to a deferred list
35 of bills and resolutions. A bill or resolution passed over after appearing
36 on three (3) committee agendas shall be moved to the deferred list. Sponsor
57 01-16-2025 14:00:54 JET019

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HR1001
1 requests to move bills or resolutions from the deferred list to the active
2 agenda must be made by 2:30 p.m. two (2) days prior to the scheduled
3 committee meeting. Bills or resolutions moved from the deferred list to the
4 active agenda shall be listed at the bottom of the active agenda. Bills or
5 resolutions on the deferred list may be moved to the active calendar as
6 provided by rule for a total of three (3) times only. A suspension of this
7 rule by the committee (two-thirds of a quorum) will be required for each
8 transfer of any bill or resolution having been moved three (3) times
9 previously.
10
11 22) Bills or resolutions suggested as non-controversial will be considered
12 before consideration of controversial bills or resolutions on the agenda.
13 The objection of one (1) committee member to the consideration of a bill or
14 resolution as non-controversial will automatically keep the bill or
15 resolution from being considered as being non-controversial. Even though a
16 bill or resolution has been considered as non-controversial, it will be
17 necessary after a “do pass” or “do pass as amended” recommendation that a
18 motion be made and there be unanimous consent of no less than a quorum of the
19 committee for a bill or resolution to be eligible to be placed on the House
20 non-controversial calendar.
21
22 23) If a bill or resolution is discussed by a committee at a meeting, but is
23 not voted on because of time limitations or because the vote is deferred to
24 the next meeting, the bill or resolution will not lose its order on the
25 agenda and will not be counted as having been considered.
26
27 24) The author/sponsor of a bill or resolution may make a presentation for
28 his or her bill or resolution and may elect at that time to respond to
29 questions from the committee members. Following the initial presentation,
30 non-legislative---non-committee members will be allowed to alternately speak
31 against and for the bill or resolution. A procedural motion made by a member
32 of the committee and adopted by the committee to limit or end debate will be
33 allowed to govern non-legislative--non-committee members' discussions. At the
34 conclusion of the non-legislative--non-committee member proponent and
35 opponent presentations, the sponsor may return to the podium and may elect to
36 field questions from the committee members. Those questions should be
58 01-16-2025 14:00:54 JET019

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HR1001
1 limited to requests for clarification or the securing of information.
2 Questions that are rhetorically offered and are dilatory for the effect of
3 debate are discouraged. At this point, the chair will entertain motions from
4 committee members only. For disposition of a proposition in a House
5 Committee, procedural motions (limit debate, immediate consideration, etc.)
6 are allowed only following a main motion (do pass, do not pass, do pass as
7 amended, etc.). Discussion from that point forward is limited to committee
8 members for and against the motion, if debatable, in alternating fashion. If
9 immediate consideration is not adopted and if debate has not been limited and
10 time has not expired, the sponsor of the motion will be allowed to close for
11 his or her motion. During the closing, the sponsor of the motion may elect
12 to field questions from committee members. At the conclusion of these
13 presentations, a vote will be taken on the motion properly before the
14 committee.
15
16 25) As determined by the presider courtesy may be extended to General
17 Assembly members who are non-committee members who need to return to their
18 own committee meetings.
19
20 26) (House Rule 66) Eleven (11) members of a standing committee constitute
21 a committee quorum with the Speaker present if he or she is a member of the
22 committee and ten (10) members when the Speaker is not present. A committee
23 recommendation of a bill or resolution will require these same numbers.
24
25 27) Smoking is prohibited in the committee rooms and all adjoining rooms.
26
27 28) (House Rule 69(a)(5)) A roll call vote will be required if requested by
28 any two (2) committee members, except for a quorum call which may be
29 requested by one (1) member. The request for a quorum call is always in
30 order.
31
32 29) When a roll call is required, the roll will be called by seniority with
33 the vice chairperson being called next to last and the chairperson last. For
34 a member's vote to be counted and recorded, he or she must vote "yes", "no"
35 or "present".

31 requiring an expenditure of public funds or otherwise imposing a new or
32 increased cost obligation is pending before any committee of the House of
33 Representatives, any member of the committee may request that a fiscal impact
