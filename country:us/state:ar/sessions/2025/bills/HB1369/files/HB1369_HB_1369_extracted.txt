11 citizens to exercise their right to political expression; that this act

13 donors, political candidates, and elected officials are free from unintended
14 limits of their political expression by providing a more efficient and
15 transparent manner of establishing the state's maximum campaign contribution
16 limit; and that this act also preserves the public peace, health, and safety

21 and safety shall become effective on:
