1 Challenge Scholarship Program, § 6-85-301 et seq., or the Arkansas Concurrent
2 Challenge Scholarship Program, § 6-85-401 et seq., is the prerogative of the
3 General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by the General Assembly's

5 with the approval of the Administrative Rules Subcommittee of the Legislative
6 Council and through oversight as required by law by the Lottery Oversight
7 Subcommittee of the Legislative Council. Further, the General Assembly

29 this section shall then be transferred to the Lottery Scholarship Trust
30 Account before December 31, 2025.
31 (c) The disbursement of funds under this section is a one-time

1 to improve the function of the lottery; that improvements in efficiency for
