1 industrial development authorities organized under the Industrial Development
2 Authorities Expansion Act, § 14-189-101 et seq., in the state in their

4 industrial facilities. This task involves the opportunity for the full
5 utilization of the benefits of financing industrial facilities under Arkansas
6 Constitution, Amendment 49 [repealed], Amendment 62, or prior amendments to
7 the Arkansas Constitution repealed by Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 62,
8 and §§ 14-164-201 — 14-164-206, 14-164-208 — 14-164-224, the Industrial
