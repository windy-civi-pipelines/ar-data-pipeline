6 5-61-302. Legislative findings and intent.
7 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
8 (1) It is time for the United States Supreme Court to redress
9 and correct the grave injustice and the crime against humanity which is being
10 perpetuated by its decisions in Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and Planned
11 Parenthood v. Casey;
12 (2) The United States Supreme Court committed a grave injustice
13 and a crime against humanity in the Dred Scott decision by denying personhood
14 to a class of human beings, African-Americans;
15 (3) The United States Supreme Court also committed a grave
16 injustice and a crime against humanity by upholding the “separate but equal”
17 doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson which withdrew legal protection from a class
18 of human beings who were persons under the United States Constitution,
19 African-Americans;
20 (4) A crime against humanity occurs when a government withdraws
21 legal protection from a class of human beings resulting in severe deprivation
22 of their rights, up to and including death;
23 (5) In Brown v. Board of Education, the United States Supreme
24 Court corrected its own grave injustice and crime against humanity created in
25 Plessy v. Ferguson by overruling and abolishing the fifty-eight-year-old
26 “separate but equal” doctrine, thus giving equal legal rights to African-
27 Americans;
28 (6) Under the doctrine of stare decisis, the three (3) abortion
29 cases mentioned in subdivision (a)(1) of this section meet the test for when
30 a case should be overturned by the United States Supreme Court because of
31 significant changes in facts or laws, including without limitation the
32 following:
33 (A) The cases have not been accepted by scholars, judges,
34 and the American people, as witnessed to by the fact that these cases are
35 still the most intensely controversial cases in American history and at the
36 present time;
2 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 (B) New scientific advances have demonstrated since 1973
2 that life begins at the moment of conception and the child in a woman's womb
3 is a human being;
4 (C) Scientific evidence and personal testimonies document
5 the massive harm that abortion causes to women;
6 (D) The laws in all fifty (50) states have now changed
7 through “Safe Haven” laws to eliminate all burden of child care from women
8 who do not want to care for a child; and
9 (E) Public attitudes favoring adoption have created a
10 culture of adoption in the United States with many families waiting long
11 periods of time to adopt newborn infants;
12 (7) Before the United States Supreme Court decision of Roe v.
13 Wade, Arkansas had already enacted prohibitions on abortions under § 5-61-101
14 et seq., and authorized the refusal to perform, participate, consent, or
15 submit to an abortion under § 20-16-601;
16 (8) Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 68, states that the policy
17 of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception
18 until birth and that public funds shall not be used to pay for any abortion
19 except to save the life of the mother;
20 (9) Arkansas passed the Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act,
21 § 20-16-1301 et seq., in 2013 which shows the will of the Arkansas people to
22 save the lives of unborn children;
23 (10) Arkansas has continued to pass additional legislation in
24 2015 and 2017 that further shows the will of the Arkansas people to save the
25 lives of unborn children;
26 (11)(A) Since the decision of Roe v. Wade, approximately
27 sixty million sixty-nine thousand nine hundred seventy-one (60,069,971)
28 abortions have ended the lives of unborn children.
29 (B) In 2015, six hundred thirty-eight thousand one hundred
30 sixty-nine (638,169) legal induced abortions were reported to the Centers for
31 Disease Control and Prevention from forty-nine (49) reporting areas in the
32 United States.
33 (C) The Department of Health reports that three thousand
34 two hundred forty-nine (3,249) abortions took place in Arkansas during 2017,
35 including abortions performed on out-of-state residents; and
36 (12) The State of Arkansas urgently pleads with the United States
3 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 Supreme Court to do the right thing, as it did in one of its greatest cases,
2 Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned a fifty-eight-year-old
3 precedent of the United States, and reverse, cancel, overturn, and annul Roe
4 v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.

6 Arkansas is abolished and protect the lives of unborn children.

36 20-16-802. Legislative findings and purpose.
30 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
2 (1) Immature minors often lack the ability to make fully
3 informed choices that take into account both immediate and long-range
4 consequences;
5 (2) The medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of
6 abortion are sometimes serious and can be lasting, particularly when the
7 minor is immature;
8 (3) The capacity to become pregnant and the capacity for mature
9 judgment concerning the wisdom of an abortion are not necessarily related;
10 (4) Parents ordinarily possess information essential to a
11 physician's exercise of his or her best medical judgment concerning the minor
12 daughter;
13 (5) Parents who are aware that their minor daughter has had an
14 abortion may better ensure that she receives adequate medical attention after
15 her abortion; and
16 (6) Parental consultation is usually desirable and in the best
17 interests of the minor.
18 (b) Based on the findings in subsection (a) of this section, the
19 General Assembly's purposes in enacting this enhancement to the State of
20 Arkansas's parental notice law are to further the important and compelling
21 state interests of:
22 (1) Protecting minors against their own immaturity;
23 (2) Fostering family unity and preserving the family as a viable
24 social unit;
25 (3) Protecting the constitutional rights of parents to rear
26 children who are members of their household;
27 (4) Reducing teenage pregnancy and abortion; and
28 (5) In light of the foregoing statements of purpose, allowing
29 for judicial bypasses of the parental notice requirement to be made only in
30 exceptional or rare circumstances.

27 As used in this subchapter:
28 (1) “Abortion” means the use or prescription of any instrument,
29 medicine, drug, or any other substance or device:

2 (B) Which causes the premature termination of the
3 pregnancy;
4 (2) “Attempt to perform or induce an abortion” means an act or
5 an omission of a statutorily required act, that under the circumstances as

8 in this state in violation of this subchapter;
9 (3) “Fertilization” means the fusion of a human spermatozoon
10 with a human ovum;
11 (4)(A) “Medical emergency” means a condition that, in reasonable
12 medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of the pregnant woman
13 that it necessitates the immediate abortion of her pregnancy:
14 (i) Without first determining post-fertilization age
15 to avert the death of the pregnant woman; or
16 (ii) For which the delay necessary to determine post-
17 fertilization age will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible
18 physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including psychological
19 or emotional conditions.
20 (B) “Medical emergency” does not include a condition based
21 on a claim or diagnosis that a pregnant woman will engage in conduct which
22 she intends to result in her death or in substantial and irreversible
23 physical impairment of a major bodily function;
24 (5) “Physician” means any person licensed to practice medicine

33 would be made by a reasonably prudent physician knowledgeable about the case
34 and the treatment possibilities with respect to the medical conditions

5 20-16-1403. Legislative findings.
6 The General Assembly finds that:
7 (1) Pain receptors known as nociceptors are present throughout
8 the unborn child's entire body by no later than sixteen (16) weeks after
9 fertilization, and nerves link these receptors to the brain's thalamus and
10 subcortical plate by no later than twenty (20) weeks;
11 (2)(A) By eight (8) weeks after fertilization, the unborn child
12 reacts to touch.
13 (B) After twenty (20) weeks after fertilization, the
14 unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied
15 to an adult human, for example, by recoiling;
16 (3) In the unborn child, application of such painful stimuli is
17 associated with significant increases in stress hormones known as the stress
18 response;
19 (4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with long-
20 term harmful neurodeveolopmental effects, such as altered pain sensitivity
21 and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later in
22 life;
23 (5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal
24 anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a decrease in
25 stress hormones compared to those levels when painful stimuli are applied
26 without such anesthesia;
27 (6)(A) The position, asserted by some medical experts, that the
28 unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point later in
29 pregnancy than twenty (20) weeks after fertilization predominately rests on
30 the assumption that the ability to experience pain depends on the cerebral
31 cortex and requires nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex.
32 (B) However, recent medical research and analysis,
33 especially since 2007, provide strong evidence for the conclusion that a
34 functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain;
35 (7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing
36 the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with hydranencephaly, nevertheless
56 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 experience pain;
2 (8) In adults, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex
3 does not alter pain perception, while stimulation or ablation of the thalamus
4 does;
5 (9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for pain
6 processing in early development differ from those of adults and use different
7 neural elements available at specific times during development, such as the
8 subcortical plate, to fulfill the role of pain processing;
9 (10) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence that an
10 unborn child is capable of experiencing pain by twenty (20) weeks after
11 fertilization;
12 (11) It is the purpose of the state to assert a compelling state
13 interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which
14 substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain;
15 and
16 (12) Mindful of Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which
17 in the context of determining the severability of a state statute regulating
18 abortion, the United States Supreme Court noted that an explicit statement of
19 legislative intent specifically made applicable to a particular statute is of
20 greater weight than a general savings or severability clause, it is the
21 intent of the state that § 1-2-117 be specifically applied to this
22 subchapter, and moreover the General Assembly declares that it would have
23 passed this subchapter, and each section, subsection, subdivision, sentence,
24 clause, phrase, or word in this subchapter, irrespective of the fact that any
25 one (1) or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses,
26 phrases, or words, or any of their applications, were to be declared
27 unconstitutional.
28
29 20-16-1404. Determination of post-fertilization age.
30 (a)(1) Except in the case of a medical emergency, an abortion shall
31 not be performed or induced or be attempted to be performed or induced unless
32 the physician performing or inducing the abortion has first made a
33 determination of the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child or
34 relied upon such a determination made by another physician.
35 (2) In making such a determination under subdivision (a)(1) of
36 this section, the physician shall make such inquiries of the woman and
57 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and tests as a
2 reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the medical
3 conditions involved, would consider necessary to accurately diagnose the
4 probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child.
5 (b) Any physician who purposely, knowingly, or recklessly fails to
6 conform to any requirement of this section engages in unprofessional conduct
7 under § 17-95-409(a)(2)(D).
8
9 20-16-1405. Abortion of unborn child of 20 or more weeks post-
10 fertilization age prohibited.
11 (a)(1) A person shall not perform or induce or attempt to perform or
12 induce an abortion upon a woman when it has been determined by the physician
13 performing or inducing or attempting to perform or induce the abortion or by
14 another physician upon whose determination that physician relies that the
15 probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child of the woman is twenty
16 (20) or more weeks.
17 (2)(A) However, subdivision (a)(1) of this section does not
18 apply if, in reasonable medical judgment, the pregnant woman has a condition
19 which so complicates her medical condition as to necessitate the abortion of
20 her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial and
21 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant
22 woman, not including psychological or emotional conditions.
23 (B) A condition creating an exemption under subdivision
24 (a)(2)(A) of this section shall not be deemed to exist if the condition is
25 based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct that she
26 intends to result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical
27 impairment of a major bodily function.
28 (3)(A) Subdivision (a)(1) of this section does not apply if the
29 pregnancy results from rape under § 5-14-103 or incest under § 5-26-202 when
30 documentation is presented that states that the crime has been reported to
31 law enforcement.
32 (B) The physician or abortion facility shall:
33 (i) File the documentation that a crime has been
34 reported to law enforcement in the pregnant woman's medical record; and
35 (ii) Report to the Department of Health the number of
36 abortions performed because of rape or incest.
58 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 (b)(1) When an abortion upon a woman whose unborn child has been
2 determined under subdivision (a)(1) of this section to have a probable post-
3 fertilization age of twenty (20) or more weeks is not prohibited by this
4 section, the physician shall terminate the pregnancy in the manner which, in
5 reasonable medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn
6 child to survive.
7 (2)(A) However, subdivision (b)(1) of this section does not
8 apply if, in reasonable medical judgment, termination of the pregnancy in
9 that manner would pose a greater risk either of the death of the pregnant
10 woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major
11 bodily function of the woman, not including psychological or emotional
12 conditions, than would other available methods.
13 (B) A risk creating an exemption under subdivision
14 (b)(2)(A) of this section shall not be deemed to exist if it is based on a
15 claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct that she intends to
16 result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of
17 a major bodily function.
18
19 20-16-1406. Reporting.
20 (a)(1) A physician who performs or induces or attempts to perform or
21 induce an abortion shall report to the Department of Health on a schedule and
22 in accordance with rules adopted by the department.
23 (2) The report required under subdivision (a)(1) of this section
24 shall include without limitation:
25 (A) Whether a determination of probable post-fertilization
26 age was made, the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child
27 determined, and the method and basis of the determination;
28 (B) If a determination of probable post-fertilization age
29 of the unborn child was not made, the basis of the determination that a
30 medical emergency existed;
31 (C) If the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn
32 child was determined to be twenty (20) or more weeks, the basis of the
33 determination that the pregnant woman had a condition which so complicated
34 her medical condition as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her
35 pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial and
36 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant
59 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 woman, not including psychological or emotional conditions;
2 (D) The method used for the abortion; and
3 (E) If an abortion was performed when the probable post-
4 fertilization age of the unborn child was determined to be twenty (20) or
5 more weeks:
6 (i) Whether the method used was one that in
7 reasonable medical judgment provided the best opportunity for the unborn
8 child to survive; or
9 (ii) If such a method under subdivision (a)(2)(E)(i)
10 of this section was not used, the basis of the determination that termination
11 of the pregnancy in that manner would pose a greater risk either of the death
12 of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical
13 impairment of a major bodily function of the woman, not including
14 psychological or emotional conditions, than would other available methods.
15 (b)(1) By June 30 of each year the department shall issue a public
16 report providing statistics for the previous calendar year compiled from all
17 of the reports covering that year submitted under this section for each of
18 the items listed in subsection (a) of this section.
19 (2) Each report also shall provide the statistics for all
20 previous calendar years during which this section was in effect, adjusted to
21 reflect any additional information from late or corrected reports.
22 (3) The department shall take care to ensure that none of the
23 information included in the public reports could reasonably lead to the
24 identification of any pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed or
25 induced or attempted to be performed or induced.
26 (c)(1) A physician who fails to submit a report by the end of thirty
27 (30) days after the date the report is due shall be subject to a late fee of
28 five hundred dollars ($500) for each additional thirty-day period or portion
29 of a thirty-day period the report is overdue.
30 (2) A physician required to report in accordance with this
31 subchapter who has not submitted a report or has submitted only an incomplete
32 report more than one (1) year following the date the report is due, in an
33 action brought in the manner in which actions are brought by the department,
34 may be directed by a court of competent jurisdiction to submit a complete
35 report within a period stated by court order or be subject to civil contempt.
36 (d)(1) Purposeful, knowing, or reckless failure by a physician to

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 conform to any requirement of this section, other than late filing of a
2 report, constitutes unprofessional conduct under § 17-95-409.
3 (2) Purposeful, knowing, or reckless failure by a physician to
4 submit a complete report in accordance with a court order constitutes
5 unprofessional conduct under § 17-95-409.
6 (3) Purposeful, knowing, or reckless falsification of any report
7 required under this section is a Class C misdemeanor.
8 (e) Within ninety (90) days after the effective date of this
9 subchapter, the department shall adopt rules to assist in compliance with
10 this section, and subdivision (a)(1) of this section shall take effect so as
11 to require reports regarding all abortions performed or induced on or after
12 the first day of the first calendar month following the effective date of
13 such rules.
14
15 20-16-1407. Criminal penalties.
16 (a) A person who purposely, knowingly, or recklessly performs or
17 induces or attempts to perform or induce an abortion in violation of this
18 subchapter is guilty of a Class D felony.
19 (b) A penalty may not be assessed against the woman upon whom the
20 abortion is performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced.
21
22 20-16-1408. Civil remedies.

26 person who purposely, knowingly, or recklessly performed or induced the
27 abortion in violation of this subchapter for actual and punitive damages.
28 (2) A woman upon whom an abortion has been attempted in
29 violation of this subchapter may bring an action against the person who
30 attempted purposely, knowingly, or recklessly to perform or induce the

5 performed or induced in violation of this subchapter;
6 (C) A prosecuting attorney with appropriate jurisdiction;
7 or
8 (D) The Attorney General.
9 (2) The injunction shall prevent the abortion provider from
10 performing or inducing and from attempting to perform or induce further

13 described in this section, the court shall also render judgment for a
14 reasonable attorney's fee in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant.
15 (d) If judgment is rendered in favor of the defendant and the court
16 finds that the plaintiff's suit was frivolous and brought in bad faith, the
17 court shall render judgment for a reasonable attorney's fee in favor of the

23 20-16-1409. Protection of privacy in court proceedings.
24 (a) In every civil or criminal proceeding or action brought under this
25 subchapter, the court shall rule whether the anonymity of a woman upon whom
26 an abortion has been performed or induced or attempted to be performed or
27 induced shall be preserved from public disclosure if she does not give her
28 consent to the disclosure.
29 (b) The court, upon motion or sua sponte, shall make a ruling under
30 subsection (a) of this section and, upon determining that the woman's
31 anonymity should be preserved, shall issue orders to the parties, witnesses,
32 and counsel and shall direct the sealing of the record and exclusion of
33 individuals from courtrooms or hearing rooms to the extent necessary to
34 safeguard the woman's identity from public disclosure.

62 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 (1) Why the anonymity of the woman should be preserved from
2 public disclosure;
3 (2) Why the order is essential to that end;
4 (3) How the order is narrowly tailored to serve that interest;
5 and
6 (4) Why no reasonable less restrictive alternative could be
7 fashioned.
8 (d) In the absence of written consent of the woman upon whom an
9 abortion has been performed or induced or attempted to be performed or
10 induced, anyone other than a public official who brings an action under § 20-
11 16-1408 shall do so under a pseudonym.
12 (e) This section is not intended to conceal the identity of the
13 plaintiff or of witnesses from the defendant or from attorneys for the
14 defendant.
15
16 20-16-1410. Construction.
17 (a) Since it is the intent of the state to assert two (2) separate and
18 independent compelling state interests, those in protecting the lives of
19 viable unborn children and protecting the lives of unborn children from the
20 stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable
21 of feeling pain, this subchapter does not repeal by implication or otherwise
22 § 20-16-705.
23 (b) This subchapter does not repeal by implication or otherwise any
24 other provision of this chapter.
25
26 SECTION 25. Arkansas Code § 20-16-1502 is repealed.
27 20-16-1502. Legislative findings and purpose.
28 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
29 (1) The use of abortion-inducing drugs, including the Mifeprex
30 regimen, also known as “RU-486” or “mifepristone”, presents significant
31 medical risks, including without limitation incomplete abortion, sepsis or
32 other infections, uterine hemorrhage, blood clots, abdominal pain, fever,
33 vomiting, headache, fatigue, pelvic inflammatory disease, and death;
34 (2) Medical evidence demonstrates that women who use abortion-
35 inducing drugs risk significantly more complications than those who undergo
36 surgical abortions;
63 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 (3) The risk of complications, as well as the failure rate for
2 drug-induced abortions, increases with advancing gestational age;
3 (4) A woman's ability to provide informed consent depends on the
4 extent to which the woman receives information sufficient to make an informed
5 choice;
6 (5) The decision to abort “is an important, and often a
7 stressful one, and it is desirable and imperative that it be made with full
8 knowledge of its nature and consequences”, as stated in Planned Parenthood v.
9 Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 67 (1976);
10 (6) To facilitate reliable scientific studies and research on
11 the safety and efficacy of abortion-inducing drugs, it is essential that the
12 medical and public health communities have access to accurate information on
13 the efficacy of abortion-inducing drugs and resulting complications;
14 (7) Abortion “recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are
15 reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly
16 respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible”, as stated
17 in Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 80 (1976); and
18 (8) “The collection of information with respect to actual
19 patients is a vital element of medical research, and so it cannot be said
20 that the [abortion reporting] requirements serve no purpose other than to
21 make abortions more difficult”, as stated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505
22 U.S. 833, 900-901 (1992).
23 (b) Based on the findings in subsection (a) of this section, it is the
24 purpose of this subchapter to:
25 (1) Protect the health and welfare of every woman considering a
26 drug-induced abortion;
27 (2) Ensure that:
28 (A) A physician examines a woman before prescribing,
29 administering, or dispensing an abortion-inducing drug; and

3 Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act”.
4
5 20-16-1902. Legislative findings and purpose.
6 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
7 (1) With regard to sex-selection abortion:
8 (A) The victims of sex-selection abortion are
9 overwhelmingly female;
10 (B) A sex-selection abortion is used to prevent the birth
11 of a child of an undesired sex;
12 (C) The United States, along with other countries, has
13 petitioned the United Nations General Assembly to declare sex-selection
14 abortion a crime against women;
15 (D) Countries such as India, Great Britain, and China have
16 taken steps to end sex-selection abortions;
17 (E) Women are a vital part of our society and culture and
18 possess the same fundamental human rights as men;
19 (F) The United States prohibits discrimination on the
20 basis of sex in various areas, including employment, education, athletics,
21 and health insurance;
22 (G) It is undesirable to have a distortion in the sex
23 ratio within a society, particularly when there is a shortage of women; and
24 (H) Countries with high rates of male preference have
25 experienced ill effects as a result of having an increasing population of
26 young, unmarried men; and
27 (2) With regard to maternal health:
28 (A) It is undisputed that abortion risks to maternal
29 health increase as gestation increases;
30 (B) The risk of death for pregnant women at eight (8)
31 weeks' gestation is one (1) death per one million (1,000,000) and rises to:
32 (i) One (1) death per twenty-nine thousand (29,000)
33 abortions between sixteen (16) and twenty (20) weeks' gestation; and
34 (ii) One (1) death per eleven thousand (11,000)
35 abortions at twenty-one (21) weeks' gestation or later;
36 (C) A woman is thirty-five (35) times more likely to die
88 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 from an abortion performed at twenty (20) weeks' gestation than she would
2 have been had the abortion been performed in the first trimester;
3 (D) A woman is ninety-one (91) times more likely to die
4 from an abortion performed at twenty-one (21) weeks' gestation or later than
5 she would have been had the abortion been performed in the first trimester;
6 and
7 (E) Because abortions performed solely based on the sex of
8 a child are generally performed later in pregnancy, women undergoing these
9 abortions are unnecessarily exposed to increased health risks, including an
10 exponentially higher risk of death.
11 (b) Based on the findings in this section, the purpose of this
12 subchapter is to:
13 (1) Ban abortions performed solely for reasons of sex-selection;
14 and
15 (2) Protect women from the risks inherent in late-term
16 abortions.

30 (c) If this section is held invalid as applied to the period of
31 pregnancy prior to viability, then the section shall remain applicable to the

9 20-16-2002. Legislative findings and intent.
10 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
11 (1)(A) The United States is one (1) of only seven (7) nations in
12 the world that permits nontherapeutic or elective abortion on request after
13 the twentieth week of gestation.
14 (B) Fully seventy-five percent (75%) of all nations do not
15 permit abortion after twelve (12) weeks' gestation, except to save the life
16 and preserve the physical health of the mother;
17 (2) Medical and other authorities now know more about human
18 prenatal development than ever before, including without limitation:
19 (A) Between five (5) and six (6) weeks' gestation, an
20 unborn human being's heart begins to beat;
21 (B) An unborn human being begins to move about in the womb
22 at approximately eight (8) weeks' gestation;
23 (C) At nine (9) weeks' gestation, all basic physiological
24 functions, buds for teeth, eyes, and external genitalia are present;
25 (D)(i) An unborn human being's vital organs begin to
26 function at ten (10) weeks' gestation.
27 (ii) Hair, fingernails, and toenails begin to form at
28 ten (10) weeks' gestation;
29 (E)(i) At eleven (11) weeks' gestation, an unborn human
30 being's diaphragm develops, which can result in hiccups.
31 (ii) In addition, an unborn human being begins to
32 move about freely in the womb; and
33 (F)(i) At twelve (12) weeks' gestation, an unborn human
34 being can open and close his or her fingers, make sucking motions, and sense
35 stimulation from outside the womb.
36 (ii) At this stage, the unborn human being takes on
93 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006
As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 “the human form” in all relevant aspects as stated in Gonzales v. Carhart,
2 550 U.S. 124, 160 (2007);
3 (3) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that a state
4 has an “important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of
5 human life” in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 162 (1973), and, specifically, that
6 “the state has an interest in protecting the life of the unborn” as discussed
7 in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833,
8 873 (1992);
9 (4)(A) The majority of abortion procedures performed after
10 fifteen (15) weeks' gestation are dismemberment abortions as defined by § 20-
11 16-1802, which are prohibited under the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection from
12 Dismemberment Abortion Act, § 20-16-1801 et seq.
13 (B) The performance of these types of abortions for
14 nontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice that is dangerous
15 for the pregnant woman and demeaning to the medical profession;
16 (5) Most obstetricians and gynecologists practicing in this
17 state do not offer or perform nontherapeutic or elective abortions;
18 (6)(A) According to a 2004 article, abortion can cause
19 significant physical and psychological risks to the pregnant woman that
20 increase with gestational age.
21 (B) Specifically, the relative physical and psychological
22 risks escalate exponentially as gestational age increases in abortions
23 performed after eight (8) weeks' gestation;
24 (7) In the vast majority of uncomplicated pregnancies, the
25 maternal health risks of undergoing an abortion become greater than the risks
26 of carrying a pregnancy to term as the second trimester progresses;
27 (8) In abortions performed after fifteen (15) weeks' gestation,
28 there is a higher risk that a pregnant woman will require a hysterectomy,
29 other reparative surgery, or blood transfusions; and
30 (9) The state has “legitimate interests from the outset of
31 pregnancy in protecting the health of women” as determined by Planned
32 Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 847 (1992),
33 as the “medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of abortion are
34 serious and can be lasting” as stated in H.L. v. Matheson, 450 U.S. 398, 411
35 (1981).
36 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to restrict the practice
94 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006

1 of nontherapeutic or elective abortions to the period up to the eighteenth
2 week of gestation.

3 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
4 (1) The prospect of creating new human life solely to be
5 exploited or destroyed has been condemned on moral grounds as displaying a
6 profound disrespect for a human life;
7 (2) Destructive human embryo research reduces the status of
8 human embryos to a mere means for possible benefit for another person;
9 (3) The moral justification of medical or scientific research
10 cannot be based upon the dehumanizing and utilitarian premise that the ends
11 justify any means;
12 (4) Research and development of therapeutic cloning and methods
13 to ethically obtain adult stem cells have contributed valuable therapeutic
14 advancements and improved patient health and have proven more promising than
15 research involving the destruction or exploitation of human embryos as a
16 therapeutic means;
17 (5) Recent and promising advances in reprogramming human cells
18 to behave as if in an embryonic state render controversial cloned human
19 embryos unnecessary for use in destructive embryo research;
20 (6) Cloning embryos and destructive embryo research require
21 human egg cells which are very expensive to obtain;
22 (7) Harvesting human egg cells also creates significant health
23 risks to a woman, including without limitation:
24 (A) Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome;
25 (B) Damage to internal organs or blood vessels;
26 (C) Infertility;

21 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
22
23 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. TITLE.
24 This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Restore Roe Act".
25
26 SECTION 2. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative intent.
27 It is the intent of the General Assembly to protect a woman’s right to
28 obtain abortion services up to the point of fetal viability, as provided for
29 in the United States Constitution, according to the United States Supreme
30 Court in the 1973 decision Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 162 (1973), with
31 limited exceptions following fetal viability for the health or life of the
32 mother or in case of rape or incest perpetrated on a minor.
33
34 SECTION 3. Arkansas Code Title 5, Chapter 61, Subchapter 3, is
35 repealed.

3 This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Arkansas Human
4 Life Protection Act”.
5
6 5-61-302. Legislative findings and intent.
7 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
8 (1) It is time for the United States Supreme Court to redress
9 and correct the grave injustice and the crime against humanity which is being
10 perpetuated by its decisions in Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and Planned
11 Parenthood v. Casey;
12 (2) The United States Supreme Court committed a grave injustice
13 and a crime against humanity in the Dred Scott decision by denying personhood
14 to a class of human beings, African-Americans;
15 (3) The United States Supreme Court also committed a grave
16 injustice and a crime against humanity by upholding the “separate but equal”
17 doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson which withdrew legal protection from a class
18 of human beings who were persons under the United States Constitution,
19 African-Americans;
20 (4) A crime against humanity occurs when a government withdraws
21 legal protection from a class of human beings resulting in severe deprivation
22 of their rights, up to and including death;
23 (5) In Brown v. Board of Education, the United States Supreme
24 Court corrected its own grave injustice and crime against humanity created in
25 Plessy v. Ferguson by overruling and abolishing the fifty-eight-year-old
26 “separate but equal” doctrine, thus giving equal legal rights to African-
27 Americans;
28 (6) Under the doctrine of stare decisis, the three (3) abortion
29 cases mentioned in subdivision (a)(1) of this section meet the test for when
30 a case should be overturned by the United States Supreme Court because of
31 significant changes in facts or laws, including without limitation the
32 following:
33 (A) The cases have not been accepted by scholars, judges,
34 and the American people, as witnessed to by the fact that these cases are
35 still the most intensely controversial cases in American history and at the
36 present time;
2 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 (B) New scientific advances have demonstrated since 1973
2 that life begins at the moment of conception and the child in a woman's womb
3 is a human being;
4 (C) Scientific evidence and personal testimonies document
5 the massive harm that abortion causes to women;
6 (D) The laws in all fifty (50) states have now changed
7 through “Safe Haven” laws to eliminate all burden of child care from women
8 who do not want to care for a child; and
9 (E) Public attitudes favoring adoption have created a
10 culture of adoption in the United States with many families waiting long
11 periods of time to adopt newborn infants;
12 (7) Before the United States Supreme Court decision of Roe v.
13 Wade, Arkansas had already enacted prohibitions on abortions under § 5-61-101
14 et seq., and authorized the refusal to perform, participate, consent, or
15 submit to an abortion under § 20-16-601;
16 (8) Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 68, states that the policy
17 of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception
18 until birth and that public funds shall not be used to pay for any abortion
19 except to save the life of the mother;
20 (9) Arkansas passed the Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act,
21 § 20-16-1301 et seq., in 2013 which shows the will of the Arkansas people to
22 save the lives of unborn children;
23 (10) Arkansas has continued to pass additional legislation in
24 2015 and 2017 that further shows the will of the Arkansas people to save the
25 lives of unborn children;
26 (11)(A) Since the decision of Roe v. Wade, approximately
27 sixty million sixty-nine thousand nine hundred seventy-one (60,069,971)
28 abortions have ended the lives of unborn children.
29 (B) In 2015, six hundred thirty-eight thousand one hundred
30 sixty-nine (638,169) legal induced abortions were reported to the Centers for
31 Disease Control and Prevention from forty-nine (49) reporting areas in the
32 United States.
33 (C) The Department of Health reports that three thousand
34 two hundred forty-nine (3,249) abortions took place in Arkansas during 2017,
35 including abortions performed on out-of-state residents; and
36 (12) The State of Arkansas urgently pleads with the United States
3 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 Supreme Court to do the right thing, as it did in one of its greatest cases,
2 Brown v. Board of Education, which overturned a fifty-eight-year-old
3 precedent of the United States, and reverse, cancel, overturn, and annul Roe
4 v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey.

6 Arkansas is abolished and protect the lives of unborn children.

14 means will with reasonable likelihood cause the death of the unborn child.

9 measure, drug, or chemical is sold, used, prescribed, or administered in
10 accordance with manufacturer instructions.
11 (d) It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under this section if
12 a licensed physician provides medical treatment to a pregnant woman which
13 results in the accidental or unintentional injury or death to the unborn
14 child.
15

36 20-16-802. Legislative findings and purpose.
30 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
2 (1) Immature minors often lack the ability to make fully
3 informed choices that take into account both immediate and long-range
4 consequences;
5 (2) The medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of
6 abortion are sometimes serious and can be lasting, particularly when the
7 minor is immature;
8 (3) The capacity to become pregnant and the capacity for mature
9 judgment concerning the wisdom of an abortion are not necessarily related;
10 (4) Parents ordinarily possess information essential to a
11 physician's exercise of his or her best medical judgment concerning the minor
12 daughter;
13 (5) Parents who are aware that their minor daughter has had an
14 abortion may better ensure that she receives adequate medical attention after
15 her abortion; and
16 (6) Parental consultation is usually desirable and in the best
17 interests of the minor.
18 (b) Based on the findings in subsection (a) of this section, the
19 General Assembly's purposes in enacting this enhancement to the State of
20 Arkansas's parental notice law are to further the important and compelling
21 state interests of:
22 (1) Protecting minors against their own immaturity;
23 (2) Fostering family unity and preserving the family as a viable
24 social unit;
25 (3) Protecting the constitutional rights of parents to rear
26 children who are members of their household;
27 (4) Reducing teenage pregnancy and abortion; and
28 (5) In light of the foregoing statements of purpose, allowing
29 for judicial bypasses of the parental notice requirement to be made only in
30 exceptional or rare circumstances.

5 20-16-1403. Legislative findings.
6 The General Assembly finds that:
7 (1) Pain receptors known as nociceptors are present throughout
8 the unborn child's entire body by no later than sixteen (16) weeks after
9 fertilization, and nerves link these receptors to the brain's thalamus and
10 subcortical plate by no later than twenty (20) weeks;
11 (2)(A) By eight (8) weeks after fertilization, the unborn child
12 reacts to touch.
13 (B) After twenty (20) weeks after fertilization, the
14 unborn child reacts to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if applied
15 to an adult human, for example, by recoiling;
16 (3) In the unborn child, application of such painful stimuli is
17 associated with significant increases in stress hormones known as the stress
18 response;
19 (4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with long-
20 term harmful neurodeveolopmental effects, such as altered pain sensitivity
21 and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later in
22 life;
23 (5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal
24 anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a decrease in
25 stress hormones compared to those levels when painful stimuli are applied
26 without such anesthesia;
27 (6)(A) The position, asserted by some medical experts, that the
28 unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point later in
29 pregnancy than twenty (20) weeks after fertilization predominately rests on
30 the assumption that the ability to experience pain depends on the cerebral
31 cortex and requires nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex.
32 (B) However, recent medical research and analysis,
33 especially since 2007, provide strong evidence for the conclusion that a
34 functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain;
35 (7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing
36 the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with hydranencephaly, nevertheless
56 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 experience pain;
2 (8) In adults, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex
3 does not alter pain perception, while stimulation or ablation of the thalamus
4 does;
5 (9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for pain
6 processing in early development differ from those of adults and use different
7 neural elements available at specific times during development, such as the
8 subcortical plate, to fulfill the role of pain processing;
9 (10) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence that an
10 unborn child is capable of experiencing pain by twenty (20) weeks after
11 fertilization;
12 (11) It is the purpose of the state to assert a compelling state
13 interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which
14 substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain;
15 and
16 (12) Mindful of Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which
17 in the context of determining the severability of a state statute regulating
18 abortion, the United States Supreme Court noted that an explicit statement of
19 legislative intent specifically made applicable to a particular statute is of
20 greater weight than a general savings or severability clause, it is the
21 intent of the state that § 1-2-117 be specifically applied to this
22 subchapter, and moreover the General Assembly declares that it would have
23 passed this subchapter, and each section, subsection, subdivision, sentence,
24 clause, phrase, or word in this subchapter, irrespective of the fact that any
25 one (1) or more sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses,
26 phrases, or words, or any of their applications, were to be declared
27 unconstitutional.
28
29 20-16-1404. Determination of post-fertilization age.
30 (a)(1) Except in the case of a medical emergency, an abortion shall
31 not be performed or induced or be attempted to be performed or induced unless
32 the physician performing or inducing the abortion has first made a
33 determination of the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child or
34 relied upon such a determination made by another physician.
35 (2) In making such a determination under subdivision (a)(1) of
36 this section, the physician shall make such inquiries of the woman and
57 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 perform or cause to be performed such medical examinations and tests as a
2 reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the medical
3 conditions involved, would consider necessary to accurately diagnose the
4 probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child.
5 (b) Any physician who purposely, knowingly, or recklessly fails to
6 conform to any requirement of this section engages in unprofessional conduct
7 under § 17-95-409(a)(2)(D).
8
9 20-16-1405. Abortion of unborn child of 20 or more weeks post-
10 fertilization age prohibited.
11 (a)(1) A person shall not perform or induce or attempt to perform or
12 induce an abortion upon a woman when it has been determined by the physician
13 performing or inducing or attempting to perform or induce the abortion or by
14 another physician upon whose determination that physician relies that the
15 probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child of the woman is twenty
16 (20) or more weeks.
17 (2)(A) However, subdivision (a)(1) of this section does not
18 apply if, in reasonable medical judgment, the pregnant woman has a condition
19 which so complicates her medical condition as to necessitate the abortion of
20 her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial and
21 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant
22 woman, not including psychological or emotional conditions.
23 (B) A condition creating an exemption under subdivision
24 (a)(2)(A) of this section shall not be deemed to exist if the condition is
25 based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct that she
26 intends to result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical
27 impairment of a major bodily function.
28 (3)(A) Subdivision (a)(1) of this section does not apply if the
29 pregnancy results from rape under § 5-14-103 or incest under § 5-26-202 when
30 documentation is presented that states that the crime has been reported to
31 law enforcement.
32 (B) The physician or abortion facility shall:
33 (i) File the documentation that a crime has been
34 reported to law enforcement in the pregnant woman's medical record; and
35 (ii) Report to the Department of Health the number of
36 abortions performed because of rape or incest.

4 section, the physician shall terminate the pregnancy in the manner which, in
5 reasonable medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn
6 child to survive.
7 (2)(A) However, subdivision (b)(1) of this section does not
8 apply if, in reasonable medical judgment, termination of the pregnancy in
9 that manner would pose a greater risk either of the death of the pregnant
10 woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major
11 bodily function of the woman, not including psychological or emotional
12 conditions, than would other available methods.
13 (B) A risk creating an exemption under subdivision
14 (b)(2)(A) of this section shall not be deemed to exist if it is based on a
15 claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct that she intends to
16 result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of

26 age was made, the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child
27 determined, and the method and basis of the determination;
28 (B) If a determination of probable post-fertilization age
29 of the unborn child was not made, the basis of the determination that a
30 medical emergency existed;
31 (C) If the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn
32 child was determined to be twenty (20) or more weeks, the basis of the
33 determination that the pregnant woman had a condition which so complicated
34 her medical condition as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her
35 pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial and
36 irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant

3 (E) If an abortion was performed when the probable post-
4 fertilization age of the unborn child was determined to be twenty (20) or
5 more weeks:
6 (i) Whether the method used was one that in
7 reasonable medical judgment provided the best opportunity for the unborn
8 child to survive; or
9 (ii) If such a method under subdivision (a)(2)(E)(i)
10 of this section was not used, the basis of the determination that termination
11 of the pregnancy in that manner would pose a greater risk either of the death
12 of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical
13 impairment of a major bodily function of the woman, not including
14 psychological or emotional conditions, than would other available methods.
15 (b)(1) By June 30 of each year the department shall issue a public
16 report providing statistics for the previous calendar year compiled from all
17 of the reports covering that year submitted under this section for each of
18 the items listed in subsection (a) of this section.
19 (2) Each report also shall provide the statistics for all
20 previous calendar years during which this section was in effect, adjusted to
21 reflect any additional information from late or corrected reports.
22 (3) The department shall take care to ensure that none of the
23 information included in the public reports could reasonably lead to the
24 identification of any pregnant woman upon whom an abortion was performed or
25 induced or attempted to be performed or induced.
26 (c)(1) A physician who fails to submit a report by the end of thirty
27 (30) days after the date the report is due shall be subject to a late fee of
28 five hundred dollars ($500) for each additional thirty-day period or portion
29 of a thirty-day period the report is overdue.
30 (2) A physician required to report in accordance with this
31 subchapter who has not submitted a report or has submitted only an incomplete
32 report more than one (1) year following the date the report is due, in an
33 action brought in the manner in which actions are brought by the department,

2 public disclosure;
3 (2) Why the order is essential to that end;
4 (3) How the order is narrowly tailored to serve that interest;

6 (4) Why no reasonable less restrictive alternative could be
7 fashioned.
8 (d) In the absence of written consent of the woman upon whom an
9 abortion has been performed or induced or attempted to be performed or

26 SECTION 25. Arkansas Code § 20-16-1502 is repealed.
27 20-16-1502. Legislative findings and purpose.
28 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
29 (1) The use of abortion-inducing drugs, including the Mifeprex
30 regimen, also known as “RU-486” or “mifepristone”, presents significant
31 medical risks, including without limitation incomplete abortion, sepsis or
32 other infections, uterine hemorrhage, blood clots, abdominal pain, fever,
33 vomiting, headache, fatigue, pelvic inflammatory disease, and death;
34 (2) Medical evidence demonstrates that women who use abortion-
35 inducing drugs risk significantly more complications than those who undergo
36 surgical abortions;
63 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 (3) The risk of complications, as well as the failure rate for
2 drug-induced abortions, increases with advancing gestational age;
3 (4) A woman's ability to provide informed consent depends on the
4 extent to which the woman receives information sufficient to make an informed
5 choice;
6 (5) The decision to abort “is an important, and often a
7 stressful one, and it is desirable and imperative that it be made with full
8 knowledge of its nature and consequences”, as stated in Planned Parenthood v.
9 Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 67 (1976);
10 (6) To facilitate reliable scientific studies and research on
11 the safety and efficacy of abortion-inducing drugs, it is essential that the
12 medical and public health communities have access to accurate information on
13 the efficacy of abortion-inducing drugs and resulting complications;
14 (7) Abortion “recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are
15 reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly
16 respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible”, as stated
17 in Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 80 (1976); and
18 (8) “The collection of information with respect to actual
19 patients is a vital element of medical research, and so it cannot be said
20 that the [abortion reporting] requirements serve no purpose other than to
21 make abortions more difficult”, as stated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505
22 U.S. 833, 900-901 (1992).
23 (b) Based on the findings in subsection (a) of this section, it is the
24 purpose of this subchapter to:
25 (1) Protect the health and welfare of every woman considering a
26 drug-induced abortion;
27 (2) Ensure that:
28 (A) A physician examines a woman before prescribing,
29 administering, or dispensing an abortion-inducing drug; and
30 (B) A woman considering a drug-induced abortion receives
31 comprehensive information on abortion-inducing drugs;
32 (3) Reduce “the risk that a woman may elect an abortion, only to
33 discover later, with devastating psychological consequences, that her
34 decision was not fully informed”, as stated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey,
35 505 U.S. 833, 882 (1992); and
36 (4) Add to the sum of medical and public health knowledge
64 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006

8
9 20-16-2002. Legislative findings and intent.
10 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
11 (1)(A) The United States is one (1) of only seven (7) nations in
12 the world that permits nontherapeutic or elective abortion on request after
13 the twentieth week of gestation.
14 (B) Fully seventy-five percent (75%) of all nations do not
15 permit abortion after twelve (12) weeks' gestation, except to save the life
16 and preserve the physical health of the mother;
17 (2) Medical and other authorities now know more about human
18 prenatal development than ever before, including without limitation:
19 (A) Between five (5) and six (6) weeks' gestation, an
20 unborn human being's heart begins to beat;
21 (B) An unborn human being begins to move about in the womb
22 at approximately eight (8) weeks' gestation;
23 (C) At nine (9) weeks' gestation, all basic physiological
24 functions, buds for teeth, eyes, and external genitalia are present;
25 (D)(i) An unborn human being's vital organs begin to
26 function at ten (10) weeks' gestation.
27 (ii) Hair, fingernails, and toenails begin to form at
28 ten (10) weeks' gestation;
29 (E)(i) At eleven (11) weeks' gestation, an unborn human
30 being's diaphragm develops, which can result in hiccups.
31 (ii) In addition, an unborn human being begins to
32 move about freely in the womb; and
33 (F)(i) At twelve (12) weeks' gestation, an unborn human
34 being can open and close his or her fingers, make sucking motions, and sense
35 stimulation from outside the womb.
36 (ii) At this stage, the unborn human being takes on

1 “the human form” in all relevant aspects as stated in Gonzales v. Carhart,
2 550 U.S. 124, 160 (2007);
3 (3) The United States Supreme Court has recognized that a state
4 has an “important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of
5 human life” in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 162 (1973), and, specifically, that
6 “the state has an interest in protecting the life of the unborn” as discussed
7 in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833,
8 873 (1992);
9 (4)(A) The majority of abortion procedures performed after
10 fifteen (15) weeks' gestation are dismemberment abortions as defined by § 20-
11 16-1802, which are prohibited under the Arkansas Unborn Child Protection from
12 Dismemberment Abortion Act, § 20-16-1801 et seq.
13 (B) The performance of these types of abortions for
14 nontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice that is dangerous
15 for the pregnant woman and demeaning to the medical profession;
16 (5) Most obstetricians and gynecologists practicing in this
17 state do not offer or perform nontherapeutic or elective abortions;
18 (6)(A) According to a 2004 article, abortion can cause
19 significant physical and psychological risks to the pregnant woman that
20 increase with gestational age.
21 (B) Specifically, the relative physical and psychological
22 risks escalate exponentially as gestational age increases in abortions
23 performed after eight (8) weeks' gestation;
24 (7) In the vast majority of uncomplicated pregnancies, the
25 maternal health risks of undergoing an abortion become greater than the risks
26 of carrying a pregnancy to term as the second trimester progresses;
27 (8) In abortions performed after fifteen (15) weeks' gestation,
28 there is a higher risk that a pregnant woman will require a hysterectomy,
29 other reparative surgery, or blood transfusions; and
30 (9) The state has “legitimate interests from the outset of
31 pregnancy in protecting the health of women” as determined by Planned
32 Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 847 (1992),
33 as the “medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of abortion are
34 serious and can be lasting” as stated in H.L. v. Matheson, 450 U.S. 398, 411
35 (1981).
36 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to restrict the practice

2 20-16-2202. Legislative findings and purpose — Public policy.
3 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
4 (1) The prospect of creating new human life solely to be
5 exploited or destroyed has been condemned on moral grounds as displaying a
6 profound disrespect for a human life;
7 (2) Destructive human embryo research reduces the status of
8 human embryos to a mere means for possible benefit for another person;
9 (3) The moral justification of medical or scientific research
10 cannot be based upon the dehumanizing and utilitarian premise that the ends
11 justify any means;
12 (4) Research and development of therapeutic cloning and methods
13 to ethically obtain adult stem cells have contributed valuable therapeutic
14 advancements and improved patient health and have proven more promising than
15 research involving the destruction or exploitation of human embryos as a
16 therapeutic means;
17 (5) Recent and promising advances in reprogramming human cells
18 to behave as if in an embryonic state render controversial cloned human
19 embryos unnecessary for use in destructive embryo research;
20 (6) Cloning embryos and destructive embryo research require
21 human egg cells which are very expensive to obtain;
22 (7) Harvesting human egg cells also creates significant health
23 risks to a woman, including without limitation:
24 (A) Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome;
25 (B) Damage to internal organs or blood vessels;
26 (C) Infertility;
27 (D) Depression; and
28 (E) Death;
29 (8) Harvesting human egg cells for research contributes to the
30 commoditization and exploitation of women;
31 (9) Public opinion is divided over the deeply conflicting moral
32 and ethical concerns:
33 (A) Related to payments to women for access to human egg
34 cells; and
35 (B) Surrounding the creation and destruction of human
36 embryos; and
103 01-16-2025 16:28:41 JMB006

As Engrossed: H1/16/25 HB1011
1 (10) Providing public funding of destructive embryo research
2 would be a misuse of revenue collected by the state.
3 (b) Based on the findings in this section, the purpose of this
4 subchapter is to further the important and compelling state interest of:
5 (1) Respecting life and fostering a culture of life;
6 (2) Directing public expenditures:
7 (A) Away from funding research that has not yielded
8 significant scientific contributions or benefit to patients; and
9 (B) Toward funding research that has already made
10 significant contributions to patients; and
11 (3) Relieving the consciences of taxpayers who:
12 (A) Are concerned about the possible exploitation of women
13 that may result from payment for human egg cells; and
14 (B) Object to human cloning and destructive embryo
15 research.
16 (c) Public funding of human cloning and destructive embryo research,
17 including embryonic stem cell research, is against the public policy of this
18 state.
