23 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code Title 15, Chapter 42, Subchapter 1, is
24 amended to add an additional section to read as follows:
25 15-42-131. Reimbursement for free or discounted licenses.
26 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
27 (1) Revenue from hunting and fishing licenses is a crucial
28 element for funding state fish and wildlife agencies’ conservation efforts
29 across the nation;
30 (2) However, well-intentioned programs to offer free and
31 discounted licenses to certain qualified individuals and groups have the
32 potential to reap deteriorative effects on the agencies’ budgets;
33 (3) To prevent the loss of sportsmen-generated dollars for
34 conservation funding, some states have enacted legislation to require
35 reimbursements to the state fish and wildlife agencies from the general funds
36 for any free and discounted licenses; and
