11 Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025".
12
13 23-4-1302. Legislative findings.
14 The General Assembly finds that:
15 (1) Significant strategic investments in electric utility
16 infrastructure and natural gas utility infrastructure are necessary to enable
17 this state to:
18 (A) Attract and serve economic development projects across
19 a variety of industries;
20 (B) Continue reliable support for existing customers by
21 investing in additions of new electric utility infrastructure and natural gas
22 utility infrastructure to support growth; and
23 (C) Replace retiring electric generation facilities and
24 other electric utility infrastructure and natural gas utility infrastructure;
25 (2) Strategic investments to ensure that electric utilities have
26 adequate dispatchable generation resources to support reliable service for
27 their customers continue to be a significant element in enabling this state
28 to attract and serve these economic development opportunities;
29 (3) Strategic investments in electric utility infrastructure and
30 natural gas utility infrastructure are needed to support the development of
31 sites designated as available for economic development projects, as these
32 sites are critical to this state’s economic development efforts;
33 (4) While Arkansas's electric utilities have pursued beneficial
34 resource acquisition opportunities for their customers, most will need to
35 construct new electric generating facilities in the near future;
36 (5) Further strategic investments in electric utility
9 03-11-2025 17:15:03 ANS209

As Engrossed: S3/11/25 SB307
1 infrastructure are needed to support the license extension for existing
2 nuclear generation resources and ensure that electric utilities maintain
3 adequate dispatchable generation resources to support reliable service for
4 their customers;
5 (6) Supporting the continued evaluation of modular reactors and
6 advanced nuclear technologies to identify opportunities to pursue strategic
7 investments in those advanced nuclear technologies if it is in the public
8 interest in considering whether or not those advanced nuclear technologies
9 become technically feasible, commercially viable, and financially viable or
10 otherwise beneficial to customers in Arkansas;
11 (7) Economic development projects and the continued provision of
12 reliable electric utility service and reliable natural gas utility service
13 are essential to the future of Arkansas;
14 (8) Failure to act now will result in the state's missing
15 transformational opportunities for economic development, including new
16 business opportunities as well as the expansion of existing businesses that
17 may not be available again for many years to come;
18 (9) These prospective and existing businesses are prepared to
19 invest in electric utility infrastructure and natural gas utility
20 infrastructure in this state and will provide employment for Arkansas
21 residents that will benefit the public interest;
22 (10) These prospective strategic investments and the resulting
23 employment and workforce development opportunities for this state will
24 produce investment, economic growth and activity, and new state and local tax
25 revenue that will strengthen communities throughout this state and will
26 enhance the state’s overall economic vitality and well-being;
27 (11) Existing regulatory frameworks for electric utilities and
28 natural gas utilities are inadequate and were not designed to enable the
29 electric utilities and the natural gas utilities to respond timely and make
30 the required level of strategic investments in electric utility or natural
31 gas utility infrastructure and the associated expenses, in addition to
32 maintaining the financial viability necessary to support strategic
33 investments requiring new infrastructure to serve the residents of Arkansas;
34 (12) Regulatory reform is required to keep pace with the
35 evolving industry and help ensure that electric utilities and natural gas
36 utilities are financially sound and able to make the strategic investments to
10 03-11-2025 17:15:03 ANS209

As Engrossed: S3/11/25 SB307
1 continue providing customers safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable
2 electric utility service and natural gas utility service;
3 (13) To support economic development in Arkansas, nothing herein
4 is intended to develop rates that would unreasonably shift costs from a
5 customer or customer class to other customers in a manner that would result
6 in rates that are not just and reasonable, not consistent with applicable
7 law, or not in the public interest;
8 (14) It is the policy of this state to maintain adequate
9 capacity of available, reliable, dispatchable, affordable, and resilient
10 electric generation to provide for the existing and reasonably projected
11 future energy consumption needs of all consumers of electricity in Arkansas;
12 (15) Arkansas can support a multitude of potential electric
13 generating resources and fuel supply resources so as to be the national
14 leader in the production of reliable and affordable energy in all forms that
15 make sense and are technically feasible, commercially viable, and financially
16 viable or otherwise beneficial to customers in Arkansas and the Arkansas
17 Public Service Commission shall ensure that generation resources will
18 maintain or improve the affordability, adequacy, and reliability of the
19 electric grid in Arkansas;
20 (16) Strategic investments will support the expansion of
21 Arkansas’s natural gas production capacity that will lead to economic growth
22 and employment opportunities in that business sector and will support the
23 continued development and use of Arkansas’s natural resources; and
24 (17) Strategic investments will enhance the capacity,
25 reliability, and resiliency of Arkansas’s electric and natural gas utility
26 infrastructure, which will support the reliability and resiliency of
27 Arkansas’s overall utility infrastructure and reliable electric and natural
28 gas utility service during extreme temperatures and other weather conditions
29 and during other periods of high demand and usage.

11 indefinitely suspended are removed from recovery through the rider in a
12 separate proceeding.
13 (B) Upon receipt of a request for recovery of costs under
14 subdivision (e)(3)(A) of this section, the commission shall determine:
15 (i) Whether recovery of those costs is in the public
16 interest; and
17 (ii) The form and timing of recovery through rates

20 total amount of revenue increase from an annual update to the rider under
21 this subchapter that exceeds a level ten percent (10%) below the national
22 average for all sectors under subdivision (f)(2)(A) of this section, the
23 investor-owned electric utility or the investor-owned natural gas utility
24 shall adjust its annual update to the rider under subsections (a)—(d) of this
25 section to include only a revenue increase that results in rates that are ten
26 percent (10%) below the national average.
27 (C) The commission shall verify that an annual update to
28 the rider under subsections (a)—(d) of this section does not include a
29 revenue increase that results in rates exceeding a level ten percent (10%)
30 below the national average unless it authorizes a greater amount under
31 subdivision (f)(1)(A) of this section.
32 (D)(i) If an investor-owned natural gas utility’s rates
33 are above the national average for all sectors calculated using the same
34 method as that used by the United States Energy Information Administration
35 and published in its most recent edition of the Natural Gas Annual report for
36 natural gas utilities, as adopted by the commission by rule, and calculated

13 for an investor-owned electric utility or an investor-owned natural gas
14 utility; and
15 (ii) The change in rates resulting from the
16 investor-owned electric utility's and the investor-owned natural gas
17 utility’s annual update to the rider under this subchapter on the investor-
18 owned electric utility's or the investor-owned natural gas utility’s rates.
