7 SECTION 3. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
8 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the sales tax holiday occurs
9 the first weekend of August each year; that the Department of Finance and
10 Administration must provide sellers at least sixty-days' notice of any
11 changes to the sales tax holiday, which means the department must notify
12 sellers by June 1, 2025, of the addition of firearm safety devices and
13 firearm storage devices to the sales tax holiday; and that this act is
14 immediately necessary because there is a mental health crisis in the state,
15 and this act will help prevent tragic deaths in the state by incentivizing
16 the purchase of firearm safety devices and firearm storage devices during the
17 sales tax holiday. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act
18 being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health,
19 and safety shall become effective on:
20 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
21 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
22 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
23 bill; or
24 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
25 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
