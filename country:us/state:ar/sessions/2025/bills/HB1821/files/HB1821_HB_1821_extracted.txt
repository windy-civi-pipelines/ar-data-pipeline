17 SECTION 3. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
18 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
19 (1) The property insurance programs for public schools, state-
20 supported institutions of higher education, and state-owned properties are in
21 a state of crisis;
22 (2) In 2023, the General Assembly authorized supplemental
23 funding to send to public schools for the purpose of offsetting premium
24 increases for public schools without implementing long-term systemic and
25 structural reforms;
26 (3) In addition to the need for short-term action by the General
27 Assembly to avert the impending premium increases for public schools, the
28 General Assembly must take an active role in crafting a long-term solution to
29 ensure the stability of the property insurance programs for public schools,
30 state-supported institutions of higher education, and state-owned properties;
31 (4) Significant market adjustments in response to natural
32 disasters in this state and in this country have resulted in the need for the
33 General Assembly to restructure and combine the property insurance programs
34 for public schools, state-supported institutions of higher education, and
35 state-owned properties under the State Captive Insurance Program created by
36 this act and to inject additional money into the State Captive Insurance

HB1821
1 Program to maintain the integrity of the State Captive Insurance Program by
2 offsetting premium increases for public schools, state-supported institutions
3 of higher education, and state-owned properties;
4 (5) The use of public adjusting by certain public schools has
5 caused an increase in property insurance premiums and a lack of viable
6 options on the insurance market for future years;
7 (6) Properties of state-supported institutions of higher
8 education have historically been undervalued, and including state-supported
9 institutions of higher education in the State Captive Insurance Program will
10 provide more attractive options for the State Captive Insurance Program on
11 the insurance market;
12 (7) Properties of state-supported institutions of higher
13 education will need to be reappraised by independent adjusters under the
14 State Captive Insurance Program to ensure proper valuation of properties;
15 (8) The continual evaluation of the State Captive Insurance
16 Program by the General Assembly is critical for:
17 (A) Maximizing the benefits to public schools, state-
18 supported institutions of higher education, and the state that are
19 participants in the State Captive Insurance Program; and
20 (B) Maintaining the continued viability of the State
21 Captive Insurance Program; and
22 (9) Accountability and transparency in the operation of the
23 State Captive Insurance Program are vital to a proper evaluation of the State
24 Captive Insurance Program.
25 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that:
26 (1) The property insurance programs for public schools, state-
27 supported institutions of higher education, and state-owned property are
28 restructured and combined for public schools, state-supported institutions of
29 higher education, and state-owned property under the State Captive Insurance
30 Program;
31 (2) Additional money shall be injected into the State Captive
32 Insurance Program to maintain the integrity of the State Captive Insurance
33 Program by managing risks for public schools, state-supported institutions of
34 higher education, and the state;
35 (3) Any additional funding provided for public schools or state-
36 supported institutions of higher education for purposes of property insurance

HB1821
1 during the Regular Session of the 95th General Assembly be considered a one-
2 time infusion of money, not a permanent funding source;
3 (4) Funding will be calculated under the State Captive Insurance
4 Program with meaningful reforms that restore permanent stability and
5 actuarial soundness;
6 (5) The use of public adjusting is prohibited by public schools
7 and state-supported institutions of higher education under the State Captive
8 Insurance Program; and
9 (6) The Insurance Commissioner, the State Insurance Department,
10 the Director of the Risk Management Division, the Secretary of the Department
11 of Transformation and Shared Services, the Division of Higher Education, the
12 Commission for Arkansas Public School Academic Facilities and Transportation,
13 the Department of Education, and the State Board of Finance shall coordinate
14 to ensure proper and effective coverage requirements and guidelines for all
15 buildings, structures, facilities, and business personal property owned by a
16 public school, state-supported institution of higher education, or the state
17 for the benefit of the State Captive Insurance Program.
18 (c) The General Assembly intends this transfer to streamline the
19 delivery of property insurance coverage for all state-owned buildings, public
20 schools and state-supported institutions of higher education to promote
21 stability and fiduciary soundness for all structures covered and potential
22 claims.

35 03/17/2025 3:16:34 PM ANS119
HB1821
1 insurance industry has led to increases in costs for public schools, state-
2 supported institutions of higher education, and taxpayers for state-owned
3 property; that these increases are not sustainable under the current system;

5 institutions of higher education, and state-owned property is needed to
6 alleviate the impact of high costs and provide a greater amount of certainty
7 concerning costs; and that this act is immediately necessary because it
8 establishes a new system for property insurance for public schools, stae-
9 supported institutions of higher education, and state-owned property to allow
10 for better utilization of state resources and greater control to regulate
11 costs. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being
12 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and
13 safety shall become effective on:
14 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
15 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
16 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the

17 SECTION 3. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
18 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
19 (1) The property insurance programs for public schools, state-
20 supported institutions of higher education, and state-owned properties are in
21 a state of crisis;
22 (2) In 2023, the General Assembly authorized supplemental
23 funding to send to public schools for the purpose of offsetting premium
24 increases for public schools without implementing long-term systemic and
25 structural reforms;
26 (3) In addition to the need for short-term action by the General
27 Assembly to avert the impending premium increases for public schools, the
28 General Assembly must take an active role in crafting a long-term solution to
29 ensure the stability of the property insurance programs for public schools,
30 state-supported institutions of higher education, and state-owned properties;
31 (4) Significant market adjustments in response to natural
32 disasters in this state and in this country have resulted in the need for the
33 General Assembly to restructure and combine the property insurance programs
34 for public schools, state-supported institutions of higher education, and
35 state-owned properties under the State Captive Insurance Program created by
36 this act and to inject additional money into the State Captive Insurance

HB1821
1 Program to maintain the integrity of the State Captive Insurance Program by
2 offsetting premium increases for public schools, state-supported institutions
3 of higher education, and state-owned properties;
4 (5) The use of public adjusting by certain public schools has
5 caused an increase in property insurance premiums and a lack of viable
6 options on the insurance market for future years;
7 (6) Properties of state-supported institutions of higher
8 education have historically been undervalued, and including state-supported
9 institutions of higher education in the State Captive Insurance Program will
10 provide more attractive options for the State Captive Insurance Program on
11 the insurance market;
12 (7) Properties of state-supported institutions of higher
13 education will need to be reappraised by independent adjusters under the
14 State Captive Insurance Program to ensure proper valuation of properties;
15 (8) The continual evaluation of the State Captive Insurance
16 Program by the General Assembly is critical for:
17 (A) Maximizing the benefits to public schools, state-
18 supported institutions of higher education, and the state that are
19 participants in the State Captive Insurance Program; and
20 (B) Maintaining the continued viability of the State
21 Captive Insurance Program; and
22 (9) Accountability and transparency in the operation of the
23 State Captive Insurance Program are vital to a proper evaluation of the State
24 Captive Insurance Program.
25 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that:
26 (1) The property insurance programs for public schools, state-
27 supported institutions of higher education, and state-owned property are
28 restructured and combined for public schools, state-supported institutions of
29 higher education, and state-owned property under the State Captive Insurance
30 Program;
31 (2) Additional money shall be injected into the State Captive
32 Insurance Program to maintain the integrity of the State Captive Insurance
33 Program by managing risks for public schools, state-supported institutions of
34 higher education, and the state;
35 (3) Any additional funding provided for public schools or state-
36 supported institutions of higher education for purposes of property insurance

2 time infusion of money, not a permanent funding source;
3 (4) Funding will be calculated under the State Captive Insurance
4 Program with meaningful reforms that restore permanent stability and
5 actuarial soundness;
6 (5) The use of public adjusting is prohibited by public schools
7 and state-supported institutions of higher education under the State Captive
8 Insurance Program; and
9 (6) The Insurance Commissioner, the State Insurance Department,
10 the Director of the Risk Management Division, the Secretary of the Department
11 of Transformation and Shared Services, the Division of Higher Education, the
12 Commission for Arkansas Public School Academic Facilities and Transportation,
13 the Department of Education, and the State Board of Finance shall coordinate
14 to ensure proper and effective coverage requirements and guidelines for all
15 buildings, structures, facilities, and business personal property owned by a
16 public school, state-supported institution of higher education, or the state
17 for the benefit of the State Captive Insurance Program.
18 (c) The General Assembly intends this transfer to streamline the
19 delivery of property insurance coverage for all state-owned buildings, public

22 claims.

HB1821
1 insurance industry has led to increases in costs for public schools, state-
2 supported institutions of higher education, and taxpayers for state-owned
3 property; that these increases are not sustainable under the current system;

8 establishes a new system for property insurance for public schools, stae-
9 supported institutions of higher education, and state-owned property to allow
