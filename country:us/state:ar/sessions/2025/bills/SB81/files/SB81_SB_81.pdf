1 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. SPECIAL
2 MAINTENANCE. The funds appropriated in the Conservation Tax Operations
3 appropriation section of this act for the Division of Arkansas State Parks
4 Special Maintenance shall be expended, after receiving prior approval by the
5 Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, for a special
6 maintenance program for the Park System. The funds provided will be used for
7 repair and upkeep of parks and museum facilities that have been deferred due
8 to lack of funds in the individual budgets of the parks and museums.
9 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
10 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year
11 is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
12 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
13 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
14 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
15 has determined that the Division of Arkansas State Parks may operate more
16 efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the Department of Parks,
17 Heritage, and Tourism authorizing broad powers under this section. Therefore,
18 it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain
19 oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint
20 Budget Committee as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by
21 the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of
22 this section or the Special Maintenance line item. If the requirement of
23 approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled
24 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section
25 and the Special Maintenance line item in the Conservation Tax Operations
26 appropriation section is void.
27 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
28 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

4 SECTION 26. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
5 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
6 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
7 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
8 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
9 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
10 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
11 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
12 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
13 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
14 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
