2 (b) of this section, in any action, claim, counterclaim, or any type of legal

23 of Article I of the United States Constitution, by Congress’s powers to raise
24 and support Armies and to provide and maintain a Navy, or by any other

29 apply in every court, both state and federal, and in every adjudicative
30 proceeding of any type whatsoever.

34 (e) An attorney representing the state, its political subdivisions, or
35 any officer, employee, or agent of this state or a political subdivision

27
28 16-132-109. Fee shifting.

30 declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent this state, its political
31 subdivision, any officer or employee of the state or a political subdivision
32 of the state, or any person from enforcing or bringing suit to enforce any
33 provision of this chapter, in a state or federal court, or that represents a
34 litigant seeking such relief in any state or federal court, is jointly and

7 03-19-2025 15:05:26 JMB140
As Engrossed: H3/19/25 HB1668
1 prevailing party incurs in the prevailing party's efforts to recover costs
2 and fees.
3 (b) For purposes of this section, a party is considered a prevailing
4 party if:
5 (1) A state or federal court dismisses any claim or cause of

7 or injunctive relief described by subsection (a) of this section, regardless
8 of the reason for the dismissal;

17 incurred while defending claims or causes of action on which the party
18 prevailed.
19 (d) Regardless of whether a prevailing party sought to recover costs
20 or attorney's fees in the underlying action, a prevailing party under this
21 section may bring a civil action to recover costs and attorney's fees against
22 a person, including an entity, attorney, or law firm, that sought declaratory
23 or injunctive relief as described in subsection (a) of this section no later
24 than three (3) years from the date on which:
25 (1) The dismissal or judgment described by subsection (b) of
26 this section becomes final on the conclusion of appellate review; or
27 (2) The time for seeking appellate review expires.
28 (e) It is not a defense to an action brought under subsection (d) of

6 defendants at the time the cause of action accrued;
7 (3) The county of the principal office in this state of any one
8 of the defendants that is not a natural person; or
9 (4) The county of residence for the claimant if the claimant is
10 a natural person residing in this state.
11 (g) If a civil action is brought under subsection (d) of this section
12 in any one of the venues described by subsection (f) of this section, then
13 the action may not be transferred to a different venue without the written
14 consent of all parties.
15 (h) Any contractual choice of forum provision that purports to require
16 a civil action under subsection (d) of this section to be litigated in
17 another forum shall be void as against public policy and may not be enforced
18 in any state or federal court.
19
20 16-132-110. Applicability.
21 (a)(1) Notwithstanding any other law, this chapter and the law of this
22 state shall apply to any social transitioning of a minor resident of this
23 state, and to any castration, sterilization, or mutilation of a minor who is
24 a resident of this state, regardless of where that treatment occurred, and to
25 any civil action brought under this chapter, to the maximum extent permitted
26 by federal law and state law.
27 (2) Any contractual choice-of-law provision that purports to
re2q8u ire the law of a different jurisdiction to apply shall be void as against
pu2b9l ic policy and shall not be enforced in any court.
30 (b) This chapter shall apply extraterritorially to the maximum extent
31 permitted by the United States Constitution and the Arkansas Constitution.
32 (c) Notwithstanding any other law, a court of this state shall have
33 personal jurisdiction over a defendant sued under this chapter to the maximum
34 extent permitted by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States
35 Constitution.
36 (d) This chapter does not limit or preclude a defendant from asserting
9 03-19-2025 15:05:26 JMB140
As Engrossed: H3/19/25 HB1668
1 the unconstitutionality of any provision or application of state law as a
2 defense to liability under this chapter or from asserting any other defense
3 that might be available under any other source of law.
4
5 16-132-111. Severability.
6 (a) Under Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which in the
7 context of determining the severability of a state statute the United States
8 Supreme Court held that an explicit statement of legislative intent is
9 controlling, it is the intent of the General Assembly that every provision,
10 section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this chapter, and
11 every application of this chapter to every person, group of persons, or
12 circumstances, are severable from each other.
13 (b)(1) If any application of a provision of this chapter to any
14 person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be invalid,
15 preempted, or unconstitutional, for any reason whatsoever, then the remaining
16 applications of that provision of this chapter to all other persons and
17 circumstances shall be severed and preserved and shall remain in effect.
18 (2) All constitutionally valid applications of the provisions in
19 this chapter shall be severed from any applications that a court finds to be
20 invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, because it is the intent of the
21 General Assembly and priority that every single valid application of every
22 statutory provision be allowed to stand alone.
23 (c) The General Assembly further declares that it would have enacted
24 this chapter, and each provision and all constitutional applications of the
25 provisions of this chapter, irrespective of the fact that any provision of
26 this chapter were to be declared invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional.
27 (d) If any provision of this chapter is found by a court to be
28 unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of that provision that do not
29 present constitutional vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in
30 force, consistent with the severability requirements of subsections (a)
31 through (c) of this section.
32 (e)(1) A court shall not decline to enforce the severability
33 requirements of subsections (a) through (d) of this section on the ground
34 that severance would rewrite the statute or involve the court in legislative
35 or lawmaking activity.
36 (2) A court that declines to enforce or enjoins a state official
10 03-19-2025 15:05:26 JMB140
As Engrossed: H3/19/25 HB1668
1 from enforcing a statutory provision does not rewrite a statute or engaging
2 in legislative or lawmaking activity, as the statute continues to contain the
3 same words as before the court's decision.
4 (3) A judicial injunction or declaration of unconstitutionality:
5 (A) Is nothing more than an edict prohibiting enforcement
6 of the disputed statute against the named parties to that lawsuit, which may
7 subsequently be vacated by a later court if that court has a different
8 understanding of the requirements of the Arkansas Constitution or the United
9 States Constitution;
10 (B) Is not a formal amendment of the language in a
11 statute; and
12 (C) No more rewrites a statute than a decision by the
13 executive not to enforce a duly enacted statute in a limited and defined set
14 of circumstances.
15 (f) If any state or federal court disregards any of the severability
16 requirements in subsections (a) through (e) of this section, and declares or
17 finds any provision of this subchapter facially invalid, preempted, or
18 unconstitutional, when there are discrete applications of that provision that
19 can be enforced against a person, group of persons, or circumstances without
20 violating federal law or the federal or state constitutions, then that
21 provision shall be interpreted, as a matter of state law, as if the
22 legislature had enacted a provision limited to the persons, group of persons,
23 or circumstances for which the provision's application will not violate
24 federal law or the federal or state constitutions, and every court shall
25 adopt this saving construction of that provision until the court ruling that
26 pronounced the provision facially invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional is
27 vacated or overruled.
28
29 SECTION 2. DO NOT CODIFY. SEVERABILITY CLAUSE. If any provision of
30 this act or the application of this act to any person or circumstance is held
31 invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of
32 this act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
33 application, and to this end, the provisions of this act are declared
34 severable.

17 incurred while defending claims or causes of action on which the party
18 prevailed.
19 (d) Regardless of whether a prevailing party sought to recover costs
20 or attorney's fees in the underlying action, a prevailing party under this
21 section may bring a civil action to recover costs and attorney's fees against
22 a person, including an entity, attorney, or law firm, that sought declaratory
23 or injunctive relief as described in subsection (a) of this section no later

25 (1) The dismissal or judgment described by subsection (b) of
26 this section becomes final on the conclusion of appellate review; or
27 (2) The time for seeking appellate review expires.
28 (e) It is not a defense to an action brought under subsection (d) of

12 in any one of the venues described by subsection (f) of this section, then
13 the action may not be transferred to a different venue without the written
14 consent of all parties.
15 (h) Any contractual choice of forum provision that purports to require
16 a civil action under subsection (d) of this section to be litigated in
17 another forum shall be void as against public policy and may not be enforced
18 in any state or federal court.
19
20 16-132-110. Applicability.
21 (a)(1) Notwithstanding any other law, this chapter and the law of this
22 state shall apply to any social transitioning of a minor resident of this
23 state, and to any castration, sterilization, or mutilation of a minor who is
24 a resident of this state, regardless of where that treatment occurred, and to
25 any civil action brought under this chapter, to the maximum extent permitted
26 by federal law and state law.

re2q8u ire the law of a different jurisdiction to apply shall be void as against
pu2b9l ic policy and shall not be enforced in any court.

9 03-19-2025 15:05:26 JMB140

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 HB1668
1 the unconstitutionality of any provision or application of state law as a
2 defense to liability under this chapter or from asserting any other defense
3 that might be available under any other source of law.
4
5 16-132-111. Severability.
6 (a) Under Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which in the
7 context of determining the severability of a state statute the United States
8 Supreme Court held that an explicit statement of legislative intent is
9 controlling, it is the intent of the General Assembly that every provision,
10 section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this chapter, and
11 every application of this chapter to every person, group of persons, or
12 circumstances, are severable from each other.
13 (b)(1) If any application of a provision of this chapter to any
14 person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be invalid,
15 preempted, or unconstitutional, for any reason whatsoever, then the remaining
16 applications of that provision of this chapter to all other persons and
17 circumstances shall be severed and preserved and shall remain in effect.
18 (2) All constitutionally valid applications of the provisions in
19 this chapter shall be severed from any applications that a court finds to be
20 invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, because it is the intent of the
21 General Assembly and priority that every single valid application of every
22 statutory provision be allowed to stand alone.
23 (c) The General Assembly further declares that it would have enacted
24 this chapter, and each provision and all constitutional applications of the
25 provisions of this chapter, irrespective of the fact that any provision of
26 this chapter were to be declared invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional.
27 (d) If any provision of this chapter is found by a court to be
28 unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of that provision that do not
29 present constitutional vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in
30 force, consistent with the severability requirements of subsections (a)
31 through (c) of this section.
32 (e)(1) A court shall not decline to enforce the severability
33 requirements of subsections (a) through (d) of this section on the ground
34 that severance would rewrite the statute or involve the court in legislative
35 or lawmaking activity.
36 (2) A court that declines to enforce or enjoins a state official
10 03-19-2025 15:05:26 JMB140

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 HB1668
1 from enforcing a statutory provision does not rewrite a statute or engaging
2 in legislative or lawmaking activity, as the statute continues to contain the
3 same words as before the court's decision.
4 (3) A judicial injunction or declaration of unconstitutionality:
5 (A) Is nothing more than an edict prohibiting enforcement
6 of the disputed statute against the named parties to that lawsuit, which may
7 subsequently be vacated by a later court if that court has a different
8 understanding of the requirements of the Arkansas Constitution or the United
9 States Constitution;
10 (B) Is not a formal amendment of the language in a
11 statute; and
12 (C) No more rewrites a statute than a decision by the
13 executive not to enforce a duly enacted statute in a limited and defined set
14 of circumstances.
15 (f) If any state or federal court disregards any of the severability
16 requirements in subsections (a) through (e) of this section, and declares or
17 finds any provision of this subchapter facially invalid, preempted, or
18 unconstitutional, when there are discrete applications of that provision that
19 can be enforced against a person, group of persons, or circumstances without
20 violating federal law or the federal or state constitutions, then that
21 provision shall be interpreted, as a matter of state law, as if the
22 legislature had enacted a provision limited to the persons, group of persons,
23 or circumstances for which the provision's application will not violate
24 federal law or the federal or state constitutions, and every court shall
25 adopt this saving construction of that provision until the court ruling that
26 pronounced the provision facially invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional is
27 vacated or overruled.
28
29 SECTION 2. DO NOT CODIFY. SEVERABILITY CLAUSE. If any provision of
30 this act or the application of this act to any person or circumstance is held
31 invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of
32 this act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
33 application, and to this end, the provisions of this act are declared
34 severable.
