subdivision, any officer or employee of the state or a political subdivision
of the state, or any person from enforcing or bringing suit to enforce any

prevailing party, including the costs and reasonable attorney’s fees that the
prevailing party incurs in the prevailing party's efforts to recover costs
and fees.

prevailed.

recovery of costs or attorney's fees in the underlying action;
(2) The court in the underlying action declined to recognize or
enforce the requirements of this section; or
(3) The court in the underlying action held that any provisions

AND

(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other law, this chapter and the law of this
state shall apply to any social transitioning of a minor resident of this
state, and to any castration, sterilization, or mutilation of a minor who is
a resident of this state, regardless of where that treatment occurred, and to
any civil action brought under this chapter, to the maximum extent permitted
by federal law and state law."

"(c) Notwithstanding any other law, a court of this state shall have

Constitution.
(d) This chapter does not limit or preclude a defendant from asserting
the unconstitutionality of any provision or application of state law as a
JMB545 - 03-17-2025 12:49:30 Amendment No. 1 to House Bill 1668 Page 9 of 11

defense to liability under this chapter or from asserting any other defense
that might be available under any other source of law.
16-132-111. Severability.
(a) Under Leavitt v. Jane L., 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in which in the
context of determining the severability of a state statute the United States
Supreme Court held that an explicit statement of legislative intent is
controlling, it is the intent of the General Assembly that every provision,
section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this chapter, and
every application of this chapter to every person, group of persons, or
circumstances, are severable from each other.
(b)(1) If any application of a provision of this chapter to any
person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be invalid,
preempted, or unconstitutional, for any reason whatsoever, then the remaining
applications of that provision of this chapter to all other persons and
circumstances shall be severed and preserved and shall remain in effect.
(2) All constitutionally valid applications of the provisions in
this chapter shall be severed from any applications that a court finds to be
invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional, because it is the intent of the
General Assembly and priority that every single valid application of every
statutory provision be allowed to stand alone.
(c) The General Assembly further declares that it would have enacted
this chapter, and each provision and all constitutional applications of the
provisions of this chapter, irrespective of the fact that any provision of
this chapter were to be declared invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional.
(d) If any provision of this chapter is found by a court to be
unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of that provision that do not
present constitutional vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in
force, consistent with the severability requirements of subsections (a)
through (c) of this section.
(e)(1) A court shall not decline to enforce the severability
requirements of subsections (a) through (d) of this section on the ground
that severance would rewrite the statute or involve the court in legislative
or lawmaking activity.
(2) A court that declines to enforce or enjoins a state official
from enforcing a statutory provision does not rewrite a statute or engaging
JMB545 - 03-17-2025 12:49:30 Amendment No. 1 to House Bill 1668 Page 10 of 11

in legislative or lawmaking activity, as the statute continues to contain the
same words as before the court's decision.
(3) A judicial injunction or declaration of unconstitutionality:
(A) Is nothing more than an edict prohibiting enforcement
of the disputed statute against the named parties to that lawsuit, which may
subsequently be vacated by a later court if that court has a different
understanding of the requirements of the Arkansas Constitution or the United
States Constitution;
(B) Is not a formal amendment of the language in a
statute; and
(C) No more rewrites a statute than a decision by the
executive not to enforce a duly enacted statute in a limited and defined set
of circumstances.
(f) If any state or federal court disregards any of the severability
requirements in subsections (a) through (e) of this section, and declares or
finds any provision of this subchapter facially invalid, preempted, or
unconstitutional, when there are discrete applications of that provision that
can be enforced against a person, group of persons, or circumstances without
violating federal law or the federal or state constitutions, then that
provision shall be interpreted, as a matter of state law, as if the
legislature had enacted a provision limited to the persons, group of persons,
or circumstances for which the provision's application will not violate
federal law or the federal or state constitutions, and every court shall
adopt this saving construction of that provision until the court ruling that
pronounced the provision facially invalid, preempted, or unconstitutional is
vacated or overruled."
