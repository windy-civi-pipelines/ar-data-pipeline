19 fees, the court shall apply out of the balance of the judgment or award an
20 amount sufficient to reimburse the pool the full amount of benefits paid on
21 behalf of the covered person under this subchapter, provided that the court
22 may reduce and apportion the pool's portion of the judgment proportionately

6 resulting from that sickness or injury.
7 (B)(i) During the pendency of any action or claim that is
8 brought by or on behalf of a covered person against a third party or its
