29 diseases affecting more than thirty million (30,000,000) Americans with more
30 than half of this number being children;
31 (3) Approximately ninety-five percent (95%) of rare diseases do
32 not have a United States Food and Drug Administration approved treatment;
33 (4) While the exact cause for many rare diseases remains
34 unknown, many rare diseases are genetic in origin and can be linked to
35 mutations in a single gene or in multiple genes that can be passed down from
36 generation to generation;
