15 TO URGE THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF
16 HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND THE
17 UNITED STATES INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON
18 HOMELESSNESS TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS.
19
20 WHEREAS, the State of Arkansas is committed to addressing homelessness
21 and housing insecurity by ensuring that housing policies and programs are
22 tailored to the unique needs of local communities and by upholding
23 accountability; and
24
25 WHEREAS, the United States Government has limited the flexibility of
26 states and local governments to adopt community-specific solutions to
27 homelessness and housing insecurity by imposing complex compliance measures
28 through its Continuum of Care Interim Rule; and
29
30 WHEREAS, the federally mandated Homeless Management Information System
31 places an undue administrative burden on state and local agencies that
32 reduces the ability of state and local agencies to focus on direct services
33 to the community due to the substantial data collection and reporting
34 requirements; and
35
36 WHEREAS, the federal requirements under the United States Department of
*CRH341*
04/04/2025 12:09:19 PM CRH341
HR1109
1 Housing and Urban Development's Performance Standards and Measures have
2 incentivized a one-size-fits-all approach that may not accurately reflect the
3 unique challenges faced by diverse communities or promote innovative,
4 community-based approaches to reducing homelessness; and
5
6 WHEREAS, federal policy mandates have limited the ability of local
7 service providers to offer a range of housing and service options, which
8 curbs flexibility and hinders efforts to support clients with varying levels
9 of need and readiness for permanent housing; and
10
11 WHEREAS, current federal standards under the Emergency Solutions Grant
12 Program restrict local agencies from utilizing resources effectively, often
13 leading to misalignment with community-specific priorities and reducing the
14 impact of services provided to some of Arkansas’s most vulnerable
15 populations; and
16
17 WHEREAS, the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act amendments of 2009
18 have resulted in a proliferation of federal mandates that limit Arkansas’s
19 ability to adapt its approach to the needs of diverse populations
20 experiencing homelessness; and
21
22 WHEREAS, Permanent Supportive Housing, while essential for many
23 individuals, should not be the sole or primary solution for all experiencing
24 homelessness, and excessive reliance on Permanent Supportive Housing
25 standards has constrained Arkansas’s capacity to develop diverse housing
26 solutions and funding structures; and
27
28 WHEREAS, block grant funding would allow Arkansas to better leverage
29 United States Department of Housing and Urban Development assistance by
30 granting the state more discretion over the allocation of funds, enabling
31 local agencies to design programs tailored to the specific needs of
32 Arkansas’s homeless and housing-insecure populations,
33
34 NOW THEREFORE,
35 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NINETY-FIFTH GENERAL
36 ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:

13 and agencies the freedom to set performance indicators that more accurately
14 reflect community needs and goals;

16 for communities to offer a variety of housing options that meet the diverse
17 needs and preferences of individuals and families experiencing homelessness;

19 Program to better align with local priorities, ensuring resources are
20 effectively allocated to maximize community impact;

22 restrictive federal mandates and increase state autonomy in addressing
23 homelessness;
24 (7) Reduce the United States Department of Housing and Urban
25 Development's role in Permanent Supportive Housing to allow local agencies
26 more freedom in implementing supportive housing options tailored to their
27 specific populations; and
28 (8) Shift United States Department of Housing and Urban
29 Development funding to block grants rather than direct assistance to enable
30 states to have greater flexibility in allocating funds to areas of greatest
31 need, allowing for a more effective response to homelessness in Arkansas.
32
33 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT upon adoption of this resolution, a copy be
34 provided to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development,
