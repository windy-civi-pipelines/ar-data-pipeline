28 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
29 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
30 (1) Arkansas's healthcare providers are at a significant
31 disadvantage as a result of national reimbursement methodologies and receive
32 some of the lowest commercial rates in the country;
33 (2) In Ark. Blue Cross & Blue Shield v. Freeway Surgery Ctr.,
34 2024 Ark. App. 540, the Arkansas Court of Appeals interpreted Arkansas law in
35 a manner that permits insurers to reimburse licensed ambulatory surgical
36 centers at rates lower than those paid to hospital-based facilities for the
*ANS427*

As Engrossed: S4/8/25 SB626
1 same outpatient services despite the clear legislative intent to ensure
2 reimbursement on an equal basis;
3 (3) The interpretation in Ark. Blue Cross & Blue Shield v.
4 Freeway Surgery Ctr., 2024 Ark. App. 540. undermines competition in the
5 healthcare marketplace, disincentivizes cost-efficient alternatives to
6 hospital-based care, and imposes financial hardships on providers operating
7 in nonhospital settings; and
8 (4) Transparency in reimbursement methodologies will promote
9 fairness in the healthcare marketplace and ensure that insurers comply with
10 existing state laws governing provider reimbursement.
11 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to:
12 (1) Ensure fair and equitable reimbursement rates for healthcare
13 clinics, hospitals, medical or imaging services performed at licensed
14 ambulatory surgical centers, outpatient psychiatric centers, and outpatient
15 imaging facilities; and
16 (2) Require insurers to:
17 (A) Reimburse healthcare clinics, hospitals, medical or
18 imaging services performed at licensed ambulatory surgical centers,
19 outpatient psychiatric centers, and outpatient imaging facilities fairly and
20 equitably;
21 (B) Disclose the insurer’s reimbursement methodologies;
22 and
23 (C) Ensure minimum reimbursement rates for healthcare
24 clinics, hospitals, medical or imaging services performed at licensed
25 ambulatory surgical centers, outpatient psychiatric centers, and outpatient
26 imaging facilities.

20
21 SECTION 5. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
22 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the absence of adequate
23 statutory enforcement of Arkansas Code § 23-79-115 has resulted in arbitrary
24 and discriminatory reimbursement practices that threaten the financial
25 viability of ambulatory surgical centers and outpatient psychiatric centers;
26 that without immediate intervention by the General Assembly to pass
27 legislation to clarify enforcement, discriminatory reimbursement practices
28 will continue to restrict patient access to cost-effective healthcare
29 providers causing irreparable harm to Arkansas residents; and that this act
30 is immediately necessary because current Arkansas law does not sufficiently
31 address transparency in healthcare pricing, the absence of proper enforcement
32 of health insurer reimbursement rate laws has allowed health insurers to
33 ignore the application of Arkansas Code § 23-79-115 that has been the law
34 since November 17, 1979, that any willing provider laws are subordinate to
35 the requirements of Arkansas Code § 23-79-115 and proper adherence to pay-
36 parity statutes ensures patient access to healthcare providers of their
9 04-08-2025 19:27:35 ANS427

As Engrossed: S4/8/25 SB626
1 choice, and that it is immediately necessary to protect against deceptive
2 insurance practices that harm the delivery of healthcare and reimbursement
3 for healthcare services in Arkansas. Therefore, an emergency is declared to
4 exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the
5 public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on:
6 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
7 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
8 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
9 bill; or
10 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
11 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
