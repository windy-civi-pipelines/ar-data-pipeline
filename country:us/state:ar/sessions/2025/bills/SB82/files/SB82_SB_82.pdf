27
28 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings.
29 The General Assembly finds that:
30 (1) Because Arkansas is a rural state, having reliable personal
31 transportation is essential for Arkansans to maintain employment, access
32 medical care, and obtain groceries and other daily necessities;
33 (2) Many working Arkansans have limited income and need
34 affordable personal transportation, which is impeded by the added expense of
35 sales and use tax on motor vehicles;
36 (3) The majority of motor vehicles that are sold for fifteen

1 thousand dollars ($15,000) or less are used motor vehicles, which means that
2 sales or use tax has been collected previously on those motor vehicles at
3 least one (1) time and often multiple times for motor vehicles that have been
4 sold several times; and
5 (4) Arkansans who can afford only a motor vehicle valued at
6 fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or less often have to trade motor vehicles
7 more often than those who can afford more expensive motor vehicles, which
8 results in these Arkansans continually having to pay sales or use tax on
9 motor vehicle purchases even though they have the least ability to afford the
10 repeated payment of those taxes.
11
12 SECTION 2. Arkansas Code § 26-52-324(a), concerning the special tax

17 receipts or gross proceeds derived from the sale of a used motor vehicle,

20 at the rate of two and eight hundred seventy-five thousandths percent
21 (2.875%):
22 (1) A used motor vehicle that has a sales price of at least ten
23 thousand dollars ($10,000) but less than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000);
24 and
25 (2) A used trailer or semitrailer that has a sales price of at
26 least four thousand dollars ($4,000) but less than ten thousand dollars
27 ($10,000).
