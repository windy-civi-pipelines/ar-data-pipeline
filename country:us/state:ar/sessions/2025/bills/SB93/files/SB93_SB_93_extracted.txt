11 SECTION 27. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
12 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL, AND TEMPORARY LAW. SCHOOL
13 SAFETY SET-ASIDE.
14 (a) (1) The Department of Education shall not begin the process of
15 promulgating rules for the distribution of funds in the School Safety Set-
16 Aside or Contingency Vote 3/5 Set-Aside until authorized by Legislative
17 Council.
18 (2) The department shall not disburse any funds in the School Safety

27 General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, for the
28 Department of Education to distribute funds for the School Safety Grant
29 program, as approved in this section as set out in subsection (a) herein, or
30 for the distribution of funds from this set-aside for unanticipated state
31 needs.
32 (c)(1) The General Assembly finds:
33 (A) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation and funding for a
34 state agency or institution each fiscal year is the prerogative of the
35 General Assembly;
36 (B) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation and funding for a
17 03-31-2025 17:29:29 KMW005
As Engrossed: S3/10/25 S3/31/25 SB93
1 state agency or institution is usually accomplished by delineating the
2 maximum amounts in the appropriation acts for the state agency or institution
3 and in the general revenue allocations authorized for each relevant fund and
4 fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law, § 19-5-101 et
5 seq.; and
6 (C) The Restricted Reserve Fund has established procedures for the
7 transfer of funds to various funds and fund accounts for the efficient and
8 effective operation of state government.
9 (2)(A) It is necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly
10 maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or,
11 if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as
12 provided in § 19-5-1263(c).
13 (B) The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or, if the
14 General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, is not a
15 severable part of § 19-5-1263.
16 (C) If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or, if
17 the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, is ruled
18 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, § 19-5-1263(c)-(e) are
19 void in their entirety.
20 (d) The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1,
21 2024 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

25 ESTABLISHMENT OF A "POSITION POOL". (a) To address needs emerging from
26 statewide education issues and the necessity of recruiting and retaining

28 agency is authorized for the 2024-2025 2025-2026 fiscal year a pool of no
29 more than five (5) Information Technology positions at a salary not to exceed
30 the maximum salary for a grade IT12. These positions are to be used by the
31 Department of Education in the event that the personal services needs of the
32 Department during the 2024-2025 2025-2026 fiscal year require additional
33 positions, either by title or in number, that are not authorized by the
34 General Assembly in the Regular Salaries section of this Act. These positions
35 may also be used to properly classify positions when the Department does not
36 have a vacant position available with the appropriate title and salary level.

As Engrossed: S3/10/25 S3/31/25 SB93
1 (b) To address needs emerging from statewide education issues and the
2 necessity of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, the Arkansas
3 Department of Education or its successor agency is authorized for the 2024-
4 2025 2025-2026 fiscal year a pool of ten (10) General Salaries positions at
5 up to a grade GS15. These positions are to be used by the Department of
6 Education in the event that the personal services needs of the Department
7 during the 2024-2025 2025-2026 fiscal year require additional positions,
8 either by classification or in number, that are not authorized by the General
9 Assembly in the Regular Salaries section of this Act. These positions may
10 also be used to properly classify positions when the Department does not have
11 a vacant position available with the appropriate title and grade level.
12 (c) Any salary determinations or adjustments administered under the
13 provisions of Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section shall be made by
14 comparing the qualifications and salary levels of similar employees in school
15 districts or in other state education agencies.
16 (d) The Department of Education is authorized to access the pool
17 positions authorized in this Section at any time when it is determined by the
18 Secretary that the need exists. The Secretary shall provide a monthly report
19 of the justification for the need to allocate titles from this growth pool to
20 the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and to the Arkansas Legislative Council
21 or Joint Budget Committee for review. The report shall also include an
22 accounting of the names, titles, and salaries of personnel whose salaries
23 have been adjusted under provisions of Subsections (a) and (b) of this
24 Section.
25 (e) If the Department of Education requests continuation of any
26 "Position Pool" position(s) as established herein during the next fiscal
27 year, the position(s) must be requested as a new position(s) in the agency’s
28 budget request.
29 (f) Determining the number of personnel to be employed by a state agency
30 is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by
31 delineating the maximum number of personnel by identifying job titles and the
32 maximum grade or salary attached to those titles. The General Assembly has
33 determined that the Arkansas Department of Education could be operated more
34 efficiently if some flexibility is given to that agency. That flexibility is
35 being accomplished by providing a position pool in Subsections (a) and (b) of
36 this Section and since the General Assembly has granted the agency broad
19 03-31-2025 17:29:29 KMW005
As Engrossed: S3/10/25 S3/31/25 SB93
1 powers under the growth pool concept, it is both necessary and appropriate
2 that the General Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the
3 position pool by requiring review of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
4 Committee in the utilization of the position pool. Therefore, the requirement
5 of review by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a
6 severable part of this section. If the requirement of review by the
7 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a
8 court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
9 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
10 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
11
12 SECTION 29. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS

14 SHARED SERVICES. (a)(1) The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State may create a
15 Shared Services paying accounts on his or her books and on the books of the
16 Treasurer of State and the Auditor of State for the payment of personal
17 services and operating expenses in the Shared Services Paying Account
18 Appropriation by the Department of Education.
19 (2) The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall direct the transfer
20 of funds and appropriations to the Shared Services Paying Account
21 appropriation section of this act on the books of the Treasurer of State, the
22 Auditor of State, and the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State.
23 (3) The transfer authority provided to the department in
24 subdivision (a)(2) of this section may be used to make transfers only within
25 the department's appropriation act or between other appropriation acts
26 authorized for the department.
27 (4) The provisions of this section shall be in effect from the
28 date of passage through June 30, 2025 2026.
29
30 SECTION 30. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
31 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
32 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
33 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
34 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
35 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
36 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
20 03-31-2025 17:29:29 KMW005
As Engrossed: S3/10/25 S3/31/25 SB93
1 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
2 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
3
4 SECTION 31. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
5 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
6 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
7 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
8 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
9 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
10 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
11 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
12
13 SECTION 32. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
14 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
15 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
16 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
17 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
18 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
19 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
20 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
21 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
22 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
23 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.

13 SAFETY SET-ASIDE.
14 (a) (1) The Department of Education shall not begin the process of
15 promulgating rules for the distribution of funds in the School Safety Set-
16 Aside or Contingency Vote 3/5 Set-Aside until authorized by Legislative
17 Council.
18 (2) The department shall not disburse any funds in the School Safety

28 Department of Education to distribute funds for the School Safety Grant
29 program, as approved in this section as set out in subsection (a) herein, or
30 for the distribution of funds from this set-aside for unanticipated state
31 needs.
32 (c)(1) The General Assembly finds:
33 (A) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation and funding for a
34 state agency or institution each fiscal year is the prerogative of the
35 General Assembly;
36 (B) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation and funding for a

As Engrossed: S3/10/25 S3/31/25 SB93
1 state agency or institution is usually accomplished by delineating the
2 maximum amounts in the appropriation acts for the state agency or institution
3 and in the general revenue allocations authorized for each relevant fund and
4 fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law, § 19-5-101 et
5 seq.; and
6 (C) The Restricted Reserve Fund has established procedures for the
7 transfer of funds to various funds and fund accounts for the efficient and
8 effective operation of state government.
9 (2)(A) It is necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly
10 maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or,
11 if the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, as
12 provided in § 19-5-1263(c).
13 (B) The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or, if the
14 General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, is not a
15 severable part of § 19-5-1263.
16 (C) If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or, if
17 the General Assembly is in session, the Joint Budget Committee, is ruled
18 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, § 19-5-1263(c)-(e) are
19 void in their entirety.

29 more than five (5) Information Technology positions at a salary not to exceed
30 the maximum salary for a grade IT12. These positions are to be used by the
31 Department of Education in the event that the personal services needs of the
32 Department during the 2024-2025 2025-2026 fiscal year require additional
33 positions, either by title or in number, that are not authorized by the
34 General Assembly in the Regular Salaries section of this Act. These positions
35 may also be used to properly classify positions when the Department does not
36 have a vacant position available with the appropriate title and salary level.

1 (b) To address needs emerging from statewide education issues and the
2 necessity of recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, the Arkansas
3 Department of Education or its successor agency is authorized for the 2024-
4 2025 2025-2026 fiscal year a pool of ten (10) General Salaries positions at
5 up to a grade GS15. These positions are to be used by the Department of
6 Education in the event that the personal services needs of the Department
7 during the 2024-2025 2025-2026 fiscal year require additional positions,
8 either by classification or in number, that are not authorized by the General
9 Assembly in the Regular Salaries section of this Act. These positions may
10 also be used to properly classify positions when the Department does not have
11 a vacant position available with the appropriate title and grade level.
12 (c) Any salary determinations or adjustments administered under the
13 provisions of Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section shall be made by
14 comparing the qualifications and salary levels of similar employees in school
15 districts or in other state education agencies.
16 (d) The Department of Education is authorized to access the pool
17 positions authorized in this Section at any time when it is determined by the
18 Secretary that the need exists. The Secretary shall provide a monthly report
19 of the justification for the need to allocate titles from this growth pool to
20 the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and to the Arkansas Legislative Council
21 or Joint Budget Committee for review. The report shall also include an
22 accounting of the names, titles, and salaries of personnel whose salaries
23 have been adjusted under provisions of Subsections (a) and (b) of this
24 Section.
25 (e) If the Department of Education requests continuation of any
26 "Position Pool" position(s) as established herein during the next fiscal
27 year, the position(s) must be requested as a new position(s) in the agency’s
28 budget request.
29 (f) Determining the number of personnel to be employed by a state agency
30 is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by
31 delineating the maximum number of personnel by identifying job titles and the
32 maximum grade or salary attached to those titles. The General Assembly has
33 determined that the Arkansas Department of Education could be operated more
34 efficiently if some flexibility is given to that agency. That flexibility is
35 being accomplished by providing a position pool in Subsections (a) and (b) of
36 this Section and since the General Assembly has granted the agency broad
19 03-31-2025 17:29:29 KMW005

As Engrossed: S3/10/25 S3/31/25 SB93
1 powers under the growth pool concept, it is both necessary and appropriate
2 that the General Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the
3 position pool by requiring review of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
4 Committee in the utilization of the position pool. Therefore, the requirement
5 of review by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a
6 severable part of this section. If the requirement of review by the
7 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a
8 court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
9 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
10 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

20 of funds and appropriations to the Shared Services Paying Account
21 appropriation section of this act on the books of the Treasurer of State, the
22 Auditor of State, and the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State.
23 (3) The transfer authority provided to the department in
24 subdivision (a)(2) of this section may be used to make transfers only within
25 the department's appropriation act or between other appropriation acts
26 authorized for the department.
27 (4) The provisions of this section shall be in effect from the

30 SECTION 30. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds

4 SECTION 31. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
5 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
6 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
7 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
8 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
9 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
10 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
11 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
12
13 SECTION 32. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
14 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
15 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
16 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
17 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
18 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
19 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
20 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
21 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
22 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
23 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
