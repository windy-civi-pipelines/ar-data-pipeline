13 SECTION 4. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
14 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the process for citizens to
15 propose initiated acts and amendments to the Arkansas Constitution is
16 critical to a well-functioning democracy in this state; that it is of the
17 utmost importance that the integrity of the initiative process be
18 strengthened through this act so that petitioners and voters maintain a high
19 degree of confidence in the soundness of their right to legislate as citizens
20 of Arkansas; and that this act is immediately necessary because any delay in
21 the implementation of this act would disrupt the initiative process for the
22 2026 general election, which would have a detrimental effect on the public
23 peace, health, and safety of Arkansas. Therefore, an emergency is declared to
24 exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the
25 public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on:
26 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
27 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
28 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
29 bill; or
30 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
31 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
