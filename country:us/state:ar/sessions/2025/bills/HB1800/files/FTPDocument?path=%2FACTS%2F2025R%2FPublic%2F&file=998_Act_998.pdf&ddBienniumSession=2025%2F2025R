23
24 21-8-1101. Legislative findings.
25 The General Assembly finds that:
26 (1) The voters, citizens, and policymakers of this state are
27 entitled to transparency in the political and propaganda activities of
28 organizations that may be controlled by or under the influence of foreign
29 countries hostile to the interests of this state and of the United States;
30 (2) In an increasingly globalized world, determining whether an
31 organization’s political and propaganda activities are funded by hostile
32 foreign interests is often difficult; and
33 (3) Legislation is needed to ensure the transparency necessary
34 to allow voters, citizens, and policymakers to evaluate whether political and
35 propaganda activities are funded by potentially hostile foreign actors.
