14 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
15 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year
16 is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
17 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
18 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
19 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
20 has determined that Building Authority Division may operate more efficiently
21 if some flexibility is provided to Building Authority Division authorizing
22 broad powers under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and
23 appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior
24 approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by
25 this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or

13 Appropriation are to be used in the event that the Building Authority
14 Division executes one or more building contracts or maintenance agreements
15 with State Agencies, and the appropriations or funds otherwise provided for

19 appropriations to Building Authority Division - Facilities Management
20 Contingency Appropriation authorized in the Building Maintenance Section of
21 this Act to execute one or more building contracts or maintenance agreements
22 with said State Agencies. Building Authority Division shall provide

24 appropriations and funds transfers and seek and receive approval of the Chief
25 Fiscal Officer of the State. Building Authority Division shall then seek and

14 Program Section of this Act from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State. The
15 request shall clearly state the amount required and such other information as
16 may be required by the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State necessary to make a
17 decision regarding the request. Upon approval of the Chief Fiscal Officer of
18 the State and prior review by the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint
19 Budget Committee, the State Auditor shall be notified as of the amount and
20 the purposes for which the appropriation and/or funding is to be transferred
21 and shall be established upon the books of the Department of Finance and
22 Administration and the State Auditor. If desired, the appropriation may be
23 supplemental to those regularly appropriated for like purposes by the General
24 Assembly for that agency.

21 If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
22 Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
23 this entire section is void.

1 SECTION 42. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
2 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
3 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
4 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
5 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary

11 SECTION 43. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General

20 SECTION 44. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
21 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
22 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
23 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
24 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
25 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
26 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
27 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
28 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
29 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
30 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.

3 AUTHORITY DIVISION - TRANSFER OF FUNDS. Building Authority Division is
4 hereby authorized, after seeking the approval of the Chief Fiscal Officer of
5 the State and the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee to
6 request transfer from the appropriation made in the Building Maintenance
7 Section for Building Maintenance to the Acquisition and Maintenance
8 appropriation in the Acquisition and Maintenance Section and to receive from

10 and the transfer of funds to be deposited into the Building Authority
11 Division Real Estate Fund to become part of the Acquisition and Maintenance
12 appropriation, and to be used for any purposes as set forth by law for said
13 Real Estate Fund.
14 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
15 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year
16 is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
17 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
18 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
19 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
20 has determined that Building Authority Division may operate more efficiently
21 if some flexibility is provided to Building Authority Division authorizing
22 broad powers under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and
23 appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior
24 approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by
25 this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or
26 Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the
27 requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
28 is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire
29 section is void.

12 appropriations and funds transferred to the Facilities Management Contingency
13 Appropriation are to be used in the event that the Building Authority
14 Division executes one or more building contracts or maintenance agreements
15 with State Agencies, and the appropriations or funds otherwise provided for
16 the Building Authority Division are not sufficient to address those needs,
17 and it is more cost effective for Building Authority Division to execute
18 these services. Any State Agency may transfer or deposit funds and
19 appropriations to Building Authority Division - Facilities Management
20 Contingency Appropriation authorized in the Building Maintenance Section of
21 this Act to execute one or more building contracts or maintenance agreements
22 with said State Agencies. Building Authority Division shall provide

24 appropriations and funds transfers and seek and receive approval of the Chief
25 Fiscal Officer of the State. Building Authority Division shall then seek and

27 Committee. The requirement of approval by the Arkansas Legislative Council

30 Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,

12 ($250,000), the agency may request a transfer from the Sustainable Building
13 Design Program appropriation authorized in the Sustainable Building Design
14 Program Section of this Act from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State. The
15 request shall clearly state the amount required and such other information as
16 may be required by the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State necessary to make a
17 decision regarding the request. Upon approval of the Chief Fiscal Officer of
18 the State and prior review by the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint
19 Budget Committee, the State Auditor shall be notified as of the amount and
20 the purposes for which the appropriation and/or funding is to be transferred
21 and shall be established upon the books of the Department of Finance and
22 Administration and the State Auditor. If desired, the appropriation may be
23 supplemental to those regularly appropriated for like purposes by the General
24 Assembly for that agency.
