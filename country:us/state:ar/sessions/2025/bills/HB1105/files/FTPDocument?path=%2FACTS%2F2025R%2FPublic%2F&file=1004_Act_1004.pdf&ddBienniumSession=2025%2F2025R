6 $12,000 and deposit same in a bank account for the purpose of purchasing
7 evidence in the course of investigating the illegal use of food
8 stamps/Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards. The funds so transferred
9 shall be subject to accounting in a manner substantially similar to that
10 employed by the Arkansas State Police for such transactions; provided
11 however, that information tending to identify participants in such
12 transactions shall be exempt from the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.
13 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024

16 SECTION 10. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
17 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. HUMAN
18 SERVICES RENOVATION FUND. Department of Human Services Renovation Fund.
19 (a) There is established on the books of the Treasurer of State, Auditor
20 of State, and the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State a fund to be known as the
21 Department of Human Services Renovation Fund.
22 (b) This fund shall be used for constructing, acquiring, renovating,
23 maintaining, repairing, and equipping facilities of the Department of Human
24 Services and for paying disallowances by the federal government.
25 (c) The fund shall consist of:
26 (1) Federal reimbursement received by the Department of Human Services and
27 deposited in the various fund accounts of the department; and
28 (2) General revenues transferred from the Division of Youth Services, the
29 Division of Aging, Adult, and Behavioral Health Services, and the Division of
30 Developmental Disabilities Services for the purposes of repairing,
31 renovating, equipping, acquiring and constructing Department of Human
32 Services facilities with an annual maximum of five million dollars
33 ($5,000,000). The projects for which these transfers are authorized must be
34 projects which were unanticipated during the preceding regular session of the
35 Arkansas General Assembly and must be projects which, if not carried out in
36 the interim period between regular sessions of the Arkansas General Assembly

As Engrossed: H3/12/25 H4/10/25 HB1105
1 would cause greater harm to the facilities, clients or programs of the
2 Department of Human Services than to wait until the next regular session.
3 (3) Other non-general revenue funds as may be available within the Department
4 of Human Services that can be used for the purposes of this fund.
5 (d)(1) At the request of the Secretary of the Department of Human
6 Services, and upon certification of the availability of such funds, the Chief
7 Fiscal Officer of the State shall initiate the necessary transfer documents
8 to reflect the transfer on the books of record of the Treasurer of State, the
9 Auditor of State, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, and the Department
10 of Human Services.
11 (2) The Secretary of the Department of Human Services shall submit any
12 transfer plan to and must receive approval of the plan from the Chief Fiscal
13 Officer of the State, the Governor and the Arkansas Legislative Council or
14 Joint Budget Committee prior to the effective date of the transfer.
15 (e) Provided, that any non-general revenue funding that may remain in the
16 fund at the end of any fiscal year shall be carried over into the next fiscal
17 year and all obligated general revenue funding that may remain in the fund at
18 the end of any fiscal year shall be carried over into the next fiscal year to
19 satisfy such legal and contractual obligations that have been entered into
20 prior to the end of the fiscal year.
21 (f) Determining the amount of funds appropriated to a state agency is the
22 prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by
23 delineating specific line items and by identifying the appropriation and
24 funding attached to that line item. The General Assembly has determined that
25 the Department of Human Services could be operated more efficiently if some
26 flexibility is given to that agency. That flexibility is being accomplished
27 by providing transfer authority in subsection (d) of this section, and since
28 the General Assembly has granted the agency broad powers under the transfer
29 authority concept, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
30 Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the transfer authority by
31 requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
32 in the utilization of this transfer authority. Therefore, the requirement of
33 approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a
34 severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the
35 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a
36 court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.

15 providing the State's matching share for payments made to that Division or
16 Office or its service providers for services eligible for federal
17 reimbursement under programs administered by the Department of Human
18 Services. The Department of Human Services shall report to the Legislative

24 provide them can vary significantly based on many factors, including natural
25 disasters, changing federal mandates and funding sources, demographic shifts,
26 fluctuating court-ordered services, social trends, and job market variations
27 such as nursing shortages. The impact of these factors through the course of
28 any fiscal year make it very difficult for the Department to accurately
29 predict the exact needs for funding, appropriation and positions in each of
30 its over 100 different appropriations. To ensure that it can respond quickly
31 to changing client needs and make the most effective use of the resources
32 allocated to it, the Department of Human Services shall be authorized to
33 utilize the reallocation of resource authority to make the proper adjustments
34 to the budgets within the Department. Therefore, upon determination by the
35 Secretary of the Department of Human Services that a reallocation of
36 resources within the department is necessary for the efficient and effective

As Engrossed: H3/12/25 H4/10/25 HB1105
1 operation of the department, the Secretary, with approval of the Governor,
2 shall have the authority to request, from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the
3 State, a transfer of positions, appropriations, line item appropriations, and
4 funds within or between existing and newly created divisions, offices,
5 sections, or units of the department. Provided, however, that no transfer of
6 funds or appropriation that provides direct support or matching support for
7 the Arkansas Medicaid Program shall be made to any other fund account or
8 appropriation that does not directly support the Arkansas Medicaid Program.
9 Further, no positions, funds, or appropriation authorized during the budget
10 process for the Division of Children and Family Services' compliance with
11 initiatives established under the Angela R. consent decree shall be
12 transferred to any other division. Nothing in this provision is intended to
13 prevent the one-time transfers of savings in any other program to the
14 Arkansas Medicaid Program, with the exception of the provisions previously
15 cited for the Division of Children and Family Services – Angela R. consent
16 decree. The Division of Developmental Disabilities – Grants to Community
17 Providers line item of the Developmental Disabilities Services - Grants-in-
18 Aid appropriation may not be decreased. The appropriation, funding, and
19 positions provided for the five Human Development Centers shall remain at a
20 level sufficient to ensure quality care for the Centers' residents. The
21 exemptions provided in this subsection whereby certain DHS Programs and
22 Divisions are protected from appropriation, fund, or position transfers are
23 applicable only to the reallocation or transfer authority granted herein, and
24 not by any reductions which are applicable to all state programs.
25 The Secretary of the Department of Human Services shall submit any
26 requests for transfers to and must receive approval of the requests for
27 transfers from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, the Governor, and the
28 Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee prior to the effective
29 date of the transfers. Provided, however, that the Department of Human
30 Services shall be limited to submitting no more than four reallocation of
31 resources transfer requests during any fiscal year. In each Departmental
32 request no single division will request reallocation for more than one
33 purpose as listed in this section. Transfer authority for unforeseen purposes
34 shall further be limited to no more than 5% of the total appropriation,
35 funding, and positions authorized for the Department. Reallocation of
36 resources transfers may include multiple items but shall be limited to the

2 i) Medicaid Program;
3 ii) Facilities and institutions costs, including operational expenses and
4 construction/renovation/equipping expenses;
5 iii) Departmental grants and contracts;
6 iv) Court ordered settlements and payments;
7 v) Payment of administrative expenses, including but not limited to, overtime
8 and other costs of personnel for critical services or functions necessary to
9 carry out the mission of the agency;
10 vi) Restructuring efforts as deemed necessary to comply with new and/or
11 unanticipated federal or state mandates; and/or
12 vii) Redirecting internal resources, both direct and/or indirect, to meet
13 client needs and services.
14 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
15 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year
16 is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
17 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
18 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
19 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly has
20 determined that the Department of Human Services may operate more efficiently
21 if some flexibility is provided to the Department of Human Services
22 authorizing broad powers under the Reallocation of Resources provisions
23 herein. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
24 Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative
25 Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this section. The
26 requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
27 is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by
28 the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional
29 by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
30 (2) If it is determined that the requested reallocation of resources
31 transfers should be made, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall then
32 initiate the necessary transfer documents to reflect the transfers upon the
33 fiscal records of the Treasurer of State, the Auditor of State, the Chief
34 Fiscal Officer of the State, and the Department of Human Services. In
35 addition, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, together with the Co-
36 Chairpersons of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, may

6 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

2 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
3 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
4 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
5 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
6 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
7 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
8 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
9 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
10 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
11 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
