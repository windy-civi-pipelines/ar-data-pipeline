10 SECTION 3. DO NOT CODIFY. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and
11 determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the process
12 for citizens to propose initiated acts and amendments to the Arkansas
13 Constitution is critical to a well-functioning democracy in this state; that
14 it is of the utmost importance that the integrity of the initiative process
15 be strengthened through this act so that petitioners and voters maintain a
16 high degree of confidence in the soundness of their right to legislate as
17 citizens of Arkansas; and that this act is immediately necessary because any
18 delay in the implementation of this act would disrupt the initiative process
19 for the 2026 general election, which would have a detrimental effect on the
20 public peace, health, and safety of Arkansas. Therefore, an emergency is
21 declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the
22 preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective
23 on:
24 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
25 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
26 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
27 bill; or
28 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
29 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
