2 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Title.
3 This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Remote and Mobile Work
4 Modernization and Competitiveness Act".
5
6 SECTION 2. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings.
7 The General Assembly finds that:
8 (1) Remote and hybrid work is a fast-growing trend in the United
9 States;
10 (2) Surveys have found that thirteen percent (13%) of employees
11 in the United States work from home, and twenty-eight percent (28%) work a
12 hybrid model;
13 (3) Arkansas's tax code has been found to be ranked forty-fifth
14 out of the fifty (50) states because of its complicated and burdensome filing
15 and withholding requirements;
16 (4) Remote and mobile work can be an opportunity to states
17 willing to make their tax codes hospitable and convenient to remote and
18 mobile workers; and
19 (5) While the state has an understandable desire to collect
20 taxes owed by individuals who spend significant time working in the state,
21 there is no compelling reason to place an outsized burden on those briefly
22 passing through the state, particularly those who have no income tax
23 liability.
24
25 SECTION 3. Arkansas Code § 26-51-202, concerning the application of
26 income tax laws to nonresidents, is amended to add an additional subsection
27 to read as follows:
28 (f)(1) The Department of Finance and Administration may enter into a
29 reciprocity agreement with another state to exempt residents of the other
30 state who earn income in this state from the tax levied under this chapter if
31 the other state has a provision in its tax laws that provides an income tax
32 exemption to Arkansas residents.
33 (2) The department shall not enter into a reciprocity agreement
34 under subdivision (f)(1) of this section unless the reciprocity agreement has
35 been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Council.

20 the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Administration and furnished

22 (2) The full amount deducted and withheld from any an employee's
23 wages during the income year shall be credited against the tax liability of
24 the employee under the Income Tax Act of 1929, § 26-51-101 et seq., for that
25 year.
26 (b)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this
27 section, every an employer who withholds less than one thousand dollars
28 ($1,000) for a full year's withholding shall report and remit annually on a
29 date specified by the secretary any amounts so withheld by the employer.
30 (2) An employer shall be advised by the secretary of the
31 employer's classification and shall report as classified until such time as
32 the employer advises the secretary in writing that the employer no longer has
33 employees or the employer is closing the business.

35 the secretary at the end of each income year all wages paid to any such

3 (c)(1) An employer is not required to deduct and withhold from an
4 employee's wages the amount determined from the withholding tables

20 (2) If an employee performs employment duties for an employer

22 calendar days during the tax year, the employer shall withhold and remit
23 taxes for every day the employee performed employment duties while present in
24 this state during the tax year, including the first fifteen (15) days in
25 which the employee performed employment duties in this state.
26 (3)(A) For purposes of this subsection, an employee is
