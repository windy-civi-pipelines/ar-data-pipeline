23 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
24 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
25 (1) Very young children under ten (10) years of age should be
26 held accountable in an appropriate way, but do not have the intellectual
27 capacity and maturity to understand the consequences of their actions and the
28 charges against them, and scientific research has found that in children this
29 young, qualities such as impulse control and future orientation are not well
30 developed in the brain;
31 (2) Children under ten (10) years of age do not have the ability
32 to form mens rea or criminal intent, but should still receive services and
33 treatment when they engage in what would otherwise be delinquent or criminal
34 behavior; and
35 (3) States such as Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota,
36 South Dakota, and Kansas have set a minimum age of delinquency adjudication

1 of ten (10) years of age with no exceptions for specific crimes.
2 (b) Therefore, it is the intent of the General Assembly to establish a
3 minimum age of ten (10) years of age before a child may be adjudicated
4 delinquent, provided that in cases involving homicide, the child be
5 adjudicated a juvenile member of a family in need of services to ensure age-
6 appropriate accountability and treatment through the supervision of the
7 courts.
