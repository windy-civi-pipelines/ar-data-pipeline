milk products are not allowed to be sold in farmers' markets; that legalizing
the sale of raw milk products, especially unpasteurized cheese, increases the
potential for farmers to produce more products for sale; that farmers need
immediate certainty on the law to be able to produce raw milk products,
especially as the biggest goat cheese production month is April; and that
this act is immediately necessary to provide certainty on the law concerning
the sale of raw milk products. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist,
and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public
peace, health, and safety shall become effective on:
(1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
(2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
bill; or
(3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto."
