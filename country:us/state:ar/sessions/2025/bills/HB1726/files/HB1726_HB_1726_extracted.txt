8 (1) "Algorithmic ranking system” means a computational process,
9 including without limitation a computational process derived from algorithmic
10 decision-making, machine learning, statistical analysis, or other data
11 processing or artificial intelligence techniques, used to determine the
12 selection, order, relative prioritization, or relative prominence of content
13 from a set of information that is provided to a user on a covered platform,
14 including without limitation:
15 (A) The ranking of search results;
16 (B) The provision of content recommendations;
17 (C) The display of social media posts; or

20 syndication contract, the person that receives access to an index of web
21 pages on the internet from an upstream provider under such contract;
22 (3)(A) "Input-transparent algorithm” means an algorithmic
23 ranking system that does not use the user-specific data of a user to
24 determine the selection, order, relative prioritization, or relative
25 prominence of information that is furnished to such user on a covered
26 platform, unless the user-specific data is expressly provided to the covered
27 platform by the user for that purpose.
28 (B) For purposes of subdivision (a)(3)(A) of this section,

21 provided by the user to the platform for such purpose.
22 (B) "Opaque algorithm" does not include an algorithmic
23 ranking system used by a covered platform if:
24 (i) The only user-specific data, including without

11 (2)(A) A covered platform operating an opaque algorithm shall:
12 (i) Provide notice to users of the covered platform:
13 (a) That the covered platform uses an opaque
14 algorithm that uses user-specific data to select the content the user sees,

16 platform whenever the user interacts with an opaque algorithm for the first
17 time that can be dismissed by the user; and
18 (b) In the terms and conditions of the covered
19 platform, in a clear, accessible, and easily comprehensible manner to be
20 updated no less frequently than one (1) time every six (6) months:

30 parameters used by the opaque algorithm; and
31 (4) Any quantities, such as time spent
32 using a product or specific measures of engagement or social interaction,
33 that the opaque algorithm is designed to optimize, as well as a general
34 description of the relative importance of each quantity for such ranking; and
35 (ii) Make available a version of the covered
36 platform that uses an input-transparent algorithm and enables users to easily
16 03-13-2025 09:54:56 LJH197
As Engrossed: H3/13/25 HB1726
1 switch between the version of the platform that uses an opaque algorithm and
2 the version of the covered platform that uses the input-transparent
3 algorithm.
4 (B) Subdivision (b)(2)(A) of this section shall not apply
5 to an internet search engine if:
6 (i) The internet search engine is operated by a
7 downstream provider with fewer than one thousand (1,000) employees; and
8 (ii) The internet search engine uses an index of web

21 engine.
22 (4) A covered platform shall not deny, charge different prices
23 or rates for, or condition the provision of a service or product to an
24 individual based on the individual’s election to use a version of the
25 platform that uses an input-transparent algorithm as provided under
26 subdivision (b)(2)(A)(ii) of this section.
27 (c) This section does not limit or prohibit a covered platform’s
28 ability to, at the direction of an individual user or group of users,
29 restrict another user from searching for, finding, accessing, or interacting
30 with a user’s or group’s account, content, data, or online community.

8 delete an account held by the minor and delete any personal data collected
9 from the minor on the service, or, in the case of a video streaming service
10 that allows a parent to create a profile for a minor, to allow a parent to
11 delete the minor’s profile, and to delete any personal data collected from
12 the minor on the video streaming service;
13 (D) For a parent to manage a minor’s privacy and account
