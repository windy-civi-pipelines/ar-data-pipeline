21 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings.
22 The General Assembly finds that:
23 (1) Certain domain extensions are restricted to government entities in
24 the United States;
25 (2) When users see a website with a ".gov", a ".mil", or a ".edu"
26 extension, they can be confident that it is an official government website;
27 (3) Using a government extension provides an additional layer of
28 security, as it requires stringent verification processes to obtain, reducing
29 the likelihood of phishing scams and other fraudulent activities;
30 (4) A government extension signifies that the website is an official
31 source of government information or services, helping to ensure that members
32 of the public have access to accurate and reliable information from trusted
33 sources; and
34 (5) Using a government extension reinforces government accountability
35 and transparency, as it clearly identifies official government entities and
36 their online presence.
