27 number as prescribed by § 27-101-304, the person making application for a

13 used motorboat is less than four thousand dollars ($4,000), no tax is due.

31 traded in as a credit or part payment on the sale of a new or used motorboat,
32 and the consumer subsequently purchases a new or used motorboat of greater
33 value within sixty (60) days of the sale, the tax levied by this chapter and
34 all other gross receipts taxes levied by the state shall be paid on the net
35 difference between the total consideration for the new or used motorboat
36 purchased subsequently and the amount received from the sale of the used
11 02-12-2025 10:39:38 CEB013

As Engrossed: S2/12/25 SB49
1 motorboat sold in lieu of a trade-in.
2 (B)(i) Upon applying for a certificate of number for the
3 new or used motorboat, a consumer claiming the deduction provided by

7 (ii) A copy of the bill of sale shall be deposited
8 with the department at the time of registration of the new or used motorboat.
9 (iii) The deduction provided by this subdivision

13 (C) If the taxpayer claiming the deduction provided in
14 this subdivision (c)(3) fails to provide a bill of sale signed by all parties

16 for the motorboat, tax shall be due on the total consideration paid for the
17 new or used motorboat without any deduction for the value of the item sold.
18 (d) The tax imposed by this subchapter does not apply to a motorboat
19 to be registered by a bona fide nonresident of this state.
20 (e) This section does not repeal any exemption from this subchapter.
21 (f)(1) Upon payment of all applicable fees, a motorboat dealer with a
22 permit under § 27-101-302(5) who has purchased a used motorboat may apply for
23 a certificate of number for the motorboat for the sole purpose of obtaining a
24 certificate of title to the vehicle without payment of use tax.
25 (2) If a certificate of number is issued for a motorboat under §
26 27-101-302(5)(C), the used motorboat titled by a dealer under this subsection
27 may not be operated on the waters of this state unless there is displayed on
28 the used motorboat the identifying certificate of number issued under § 27-
29 101-302(5)(C).
30 (g)(1) For purposes of this section, the total consideration for a
31 used motorboat shall be presumed to be the greater of the actual sales price
32 as provided on a bill of sale, invoice or financing agreement, or the average
33 loan value of the motorboat as listed in the most current edition of a
34 publication which is generally accepted by the industry as providing an
35 accurate valuation of used motorboats.
36 (2) If the published loan value exceeds the invoiced price, the
12 02-12-2025 10:39:38 CEB013

1 taxpayer shall establish to the secretary's satisfaction that the price
2 reflected on the invoice or other document is true and correct.
3 (3) If the secretary determines that the invoiced price is not
4 the actual selling price of the motorboat, the total consideration shall be
5 deemed to be the published loan value.
