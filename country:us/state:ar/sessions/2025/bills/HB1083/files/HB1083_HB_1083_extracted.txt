11 the algorithm; and
12 (4) Any quantities, such as time spent
13 using a product or specific measures of engagement or social interaction,
14 that the algorithm is designed to optimize, as well as a general description
15 of the relative importance of each quantity for such ranking; and
16 (ii) Make available a version of the platform that
17 uses an input-transparent algorithm and enables users to easily switch
18 between the version of the platform that uses an opaque algorithm and the
19 version of the platform that uses the input-transparent algorithm.

22 (i) The search engine is operated by a downstream
23 provider with fewer than one thousand (1,000) employees; and
