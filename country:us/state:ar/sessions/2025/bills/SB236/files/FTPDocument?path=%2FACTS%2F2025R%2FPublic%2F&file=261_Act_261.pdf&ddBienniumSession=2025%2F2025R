9 commissioner — Hearing.
10 (a) The Insurance Commissioner shall approve any merger or other
11 acquisition of control referred to in § 23-63-506 unless, after a public
12 hearing thereon on the merger or other acquisition of control, he or she
13 finds that:
14 (1) After change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in
15 § 23-63-506 would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of
16 a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently
17 licensed;
18 (2)(A) The effect of the merger or other acquisition of control
19 would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or

22 (a)(2)(A) of this section:
23 (i) The information required under §§ 23-63-527(b)

2 (5) The plans or proposals which the acquiring party has to
3 liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or consolidate or merge it with any
4 person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate
5 structure or management are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the
6 insurer and not in the public interest; or
7 (6) The competence, experience, and integrity of those persons
8 who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be
9 in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit
10 the merger or other acquisition of control.
11 (b)(1) The public hearing referred to in subsection (a) of this
12 section shall be held within thirty (30) days after the statement required by

24 state shall be made not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the date of
25 notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to § 23-63-506(b).
26 (4) At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the
27 insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person
28 whose interests may be affected thereby shall have the right to present
29 evidence, examine, and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written
30 arguments and, in connection therewith, shall be entitled to conduct
31 discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the
32 courts of this state.
33 (5) All discovery proceedings shall be concluded not later than
34 three (3) days prior to before the commencement of the public hearing.
