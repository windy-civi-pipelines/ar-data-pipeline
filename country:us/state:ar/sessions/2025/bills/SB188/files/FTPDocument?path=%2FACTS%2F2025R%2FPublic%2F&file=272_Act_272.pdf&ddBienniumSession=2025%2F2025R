6 measure.
7 (e)(1) After a proposed measure has been certified by the Attorney
8 General, within five (5) business days of soliciting or otherwise gathering
9 signatures for a proposed measure, the sponsor shall provide the following
10 information to the Secretary of State:

25 (C) The Secretary of State may remove the information

1 (b) An Arkansas circuit court and the time for
2 filing the notice of appeal has expired; or
3 (iv) The Secretary of State independently determines
4 that the language submitted by the sponsor does not accurately reflect a
5 proposed measure certified by the Attorney General or that is actively being
6 circulated for signatures to the people of Arkansas.
7 (e)(f) If, as a result of his or her review of the ballot title and
8 popular name of a proposed initiated act or a proposed amendment to the
9 Arkansas Constitution, the Attorney General determines that the ballot title
10 or the nature of the issue, is presented in such manner that the ballot title
11 would be misleading or designed in such manner that a vote “FOR” the issue
12 would be a vote against the matter or viewpoint that the voter believes
13 himself or herself casting a vote for, or, conversely, that a vote “AGAINST”
14 the issue would be a vote for a viewpoint that the voter is against, the
15 Attorney General may reject the entire ballot title, popular name, and
16 petition and state his or her reasons therefor and instruct the petitioners
17 to redesign the proposed measure and the ballot title and popular name in a
18 manner that would not be misleading.
19 (g) If the Secretary of State independently determines that a proposed
20 measure is actively being circulated for signatures to the people of Arkansas
21 and the sponsor has not submitted the information required under subdivision
22 (e)(1) of this section to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State may
23 obtain the information from the Attorney General and post the information
24 required under subdivision (e)(1)(A)-(C) of this section on the Secretary of
25 State’s website.
26 (h) If the sponsor of a proposed measure fails to comply with this
27 section, that failure shall not contribute in any way to a determination by
28 the Secretary of State that the proposed measure, or any individual signature
29 submitted to the Secretary of State in connection with the proposed measure,
30 is insufficient for any reason.
31 (f)(i) If the Attorney General refuses to act or if the sponsors feel
32 aggrieved at the Attorney General's acts in such premises, the sponsors may,
33 by petition, apply to the Supreme Court for proper relief.
