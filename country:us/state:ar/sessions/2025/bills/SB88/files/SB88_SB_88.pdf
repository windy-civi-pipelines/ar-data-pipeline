28 DHE - REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES FOR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. Upon
29 determination by the president or chancellor of an institution of higher
30 education that a reallocation of resources for purposes of reorganization or
31 consolidation of administrative functions within the institution is necessary
32 for efficient and effective operations of the institution, the president or
33 chancellor, with approval of the institution's board of trustees, may have
34 the authority to transfer positions, appropriations and related funds between
35 campuses, divisions, branches, and other budgetary units of the institution,
36 after receiving prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget

As Engrossed: S3/17/25 S4/3/25 SB88
1 Committee. The transfers of positions, programs, or activities shall be used
2 for those purposes for which the appropriations were approved by the General
3 Assembly. The transfers, consolidations, or reorganizations which involve
4 academic programs shall be reviewed by the Division of Higher Education prior
5 to submission to the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee. Provided,
6 however, that the institution shall be limited to submitting no more than two
7 (2) individual transaction transfer requests during any fiscal year and shall
8 be further limited to no more than five percent (5%) of the total General
9 Revenue and Special Revenue appropriation, funding, positions specific to
10 each institution, and no Tobacco Settlement funds or appropriations may be
11 reallocated pursuant to this section.
12 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
13 appropriation and general revenue funding for institutions of higher
14 education each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This
15 is usually accomplished by delineating such maximums in the appropriation
16 act(s) for institutions of higher education and the general revenue
17 allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the
18 Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that
19 institutions of higher education may operate more efficiently if some
20 flexibility is provided to institutions of higher education authorizing broad
21 powers under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate
22 that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of
23 the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this
24 section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint
25 Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement
26 of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled
27 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is
28 void.
29 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024

27 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
