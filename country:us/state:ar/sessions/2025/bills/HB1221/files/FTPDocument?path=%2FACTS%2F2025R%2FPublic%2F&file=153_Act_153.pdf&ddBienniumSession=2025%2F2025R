32 propose initiated acts and amendments to the Arkansas Constitution is
33 critical to a well-functioning democracy in this state; that it is of the
34 utmost importance that the integrity of the initiative process be
35 strengthened through this act so that voters maintain a high degree of
36 confidence in the actions of government; that few things are more important

HB1221
1 to the public peace, health, and safety than maintaining trust in the actions
2 of government; that the changes to the initiative process under this act are
3 critical to ensure that integrity is maintained in the initiative process;
4 and that any delay in the implementation of this act would disrupt the
5 initiative process for the 2026 general election, which would have a
6 detrimental effect on the public peace, health, and safety of Arkansas.
7 Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately
8 necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall
9 become effective on:
10 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
11 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
12 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
13 bill; or
14 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
15 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
