6 construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and
7 administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly
8 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to
9 limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
10 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase,
11 clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent
12 jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, a State

25 remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full
26 force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.

26 Adverse Action of a Remote State.
27 C. A Home State shall retain authority to complete any pending

2 2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an Encumbrance on a
3 Licensee’s Authorization to Practice in that State.
4 3. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require
5 the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as the production of
6 evidence. Subpoenas issued by a Licensing Authority in a Member State for the
7 attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from
8 another Member State shall be enforced in the latter State by any court of
9 competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court
10 applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings before it. The issuing

26 order.
27 G. If Adverse Action is taken by a Remote State against a Licensee’s
28 Authorization to Practice, that Adverse Action applies to all Authorizations
29 to Practice in all Remote States. A Licensee whose Authorization to Practice
30 in a Remote State is removed for a specified period of time is not eligible
31 to apply for a new Multistate License in any other State until the specific
32 time for removal of the Authorization to Practice has passed and all

34 H. Nothing in this Compact shall override a Member State’s authority to
35 accept a Licensee’s participation in an Alternative Program in lieu of
36 Adverse Action. A Licensee’s Multistate License shall be suspended for the

26 ARTICLE 12- EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
27 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
28 statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
29 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission shall
30 convene and review the enactment of each of the Charter Member States to
31 determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Member State is
32 materially different than the model Compact statute.
33 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be

1 terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in
2 existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member
3 States should be less than seven (7).
4 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the Charter Member
5 States shall be subject to the process set forth in Article 8.C.23 to
6 determine if their enactments are materially different from the model Compact
7 statute and whether they qualify for participation in the Compact.
8 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
9 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the
10 effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall
11 be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated
12 by the Commission.
13 4. Any State that joins the Compact shall be subject to the
14 Commission’s Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact
15 becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the
16 Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact
17 becomes law in that State.
18 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute
19 repealing that State’s enactment of the Compact.
20 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until one hundred
21 eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.
22 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
23 withdrawing State’s Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and
24 Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective
25 date of withdrawal.
26 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this Compact, a
27 State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees
28 within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the
29 contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize all licenses
30 granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of
31 such notice of withdrawal.
32 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or
33 prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a
34 Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the
35 provisions of this Compact.
36 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to this

1 Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is
2 enacted into the laws of all Member States.

4 ARTICLE 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
5 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall be liberally
6 construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and
7 administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly
8 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to
9 limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
10 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase,
11 clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent
12 jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, a State
13 seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the
14 applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is
15 held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
16 validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to
17 any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected
18 thereby.
19 C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this article, the Commission may deny a
20 State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements
21 of Article 11.B, terminate a Member State’s participation in the Compact, if
22 it determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a
23 material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held
24 to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall
25 remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full
26 force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.
27
28 ARTICLE 14. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
29
30 Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a
31 Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
32
33 Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a Member
34 State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the
35 conflict.
