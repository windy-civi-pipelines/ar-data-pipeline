8 released directly to the patient or any individual authorized by the patient
9 to receive their medical records for up to thirty (30) days if the medical
10 provider:
11 (1) Reasonably believes that immediate disclosure of the medical

25 temporarily withhold medical records in order to safeguard patients during
26 the information disclosure process. Therefore, an emergency is declared to

28 health, and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2025.
