8 9-27-302. Purposes — Construction.
9 This subchapter shall be liberally construed to the end that its
10 purposes may be carried out:
11 (1) To assure that all juveniles brought to the attention of the
12 courts receive the guidance, care, and control, preferably in each juvenile's
13 own home when the juvenile's health and safety are not at risk, that will
14 best serve the emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the juvenile and
15 the best interest of the state;
16 (2)(A) To preserve and strengthen the juvenile's family ties
17 when it is in the best interest of the juvenile;
18 (B) To protect a juvenile by considering the juvenile's
19 health and safety as the paramount concerns in determining whether or not to
20 remove the juvenile from the custody of his or her parents or custodians,
21 removing the juvenile only when the safety and protection of the public
22 cannot adequately be safeguarded without such removal;
23 (C) When a juvenile is removed from his or her own family,
24 to secure for him or her custody, care, and discipline with primary emphasis
25 on ensuring the health and safety of the juvenile while in the out-of-home
26 placement; and

28 permanently removed from the custody of his or her parents, that the juvenile
29 be placed in an approved family home and be made a member of the family by
30 adoption;
31 (3) To protect society more effectively by substituting for
32 retributive punishment, whenever possible, methods of offender rehabilitation
33 and rehabilitative restitution, recognizing that the application of sanctions
34 that are consistent with the seriousness of the offense is appropriate in all
35 cases; and
36 (4) To provide means through which the provisions of this

15 (c) The petitioner shall have the burden of proof by clear and
16 convincing evidence that the restraint on the juvenile's liberty is necessary

79 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 the allegations in a petition are substantiated by the proof.
2 (B)(i) If the court finds that the juvenile is dependent-
3 neglected, the court shall determine whether a noncustodial parent
4 contributed to the dependency-neglect and whether the noncustodial parent is
5 a fit parent for purposes of custody or family time.
6 (ii) A noncustodial parent in subdivision
7 (a)(1)(B)(i) of this section is presumed to be a fit parent.
8 (iii)(a) If no prior court order has been
9 entered into evidence concerning custody or family time with the noncustodial
10 parent of the juvenile subject to the dependency-neglect petition, the
11 petitioner shall, and any party may, provide evidence to the court whether

18 transfer custody, or the court may order family time with the noncustodial
19 parent.
20 (b) An order of transfer of custody to the
21 noncustodial parent does not relieve the Department of Human Services of the
22 responsibility to provide services to the parent from whom custody was
23 removed, unless the court enters an order to relieve the department of the
24 responsibility.
25 (c) A home study is not required to transfer
26 custody to a parent of the juvenile.
27 (v) If the court determines that the child cannot

30 corrected by the noncustodial parent before placement or family time with the
31 juvenile.
32 (2) Unless the court finds that a removal occurred due to an
33 emergency and the agency had no prior contact with the family or the child,
34 evidence shall be presented to the court regarding all prior contact between
35 the agency and the juvenile or the family before a finding of reasonable
36 efforts to prevent removal by the department.

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320

2 juvenile is void if the court determines that the department failed to
3 disclose all prior contact between the agency and juvenile or the family
4 before the finding.
5 (4)(A) The dependency-neglect adjudication hearing shall be held
6 within thirty (30) days after the probable cause hearing under § 9-27-315.

23 (5) If the juvenile has previously been adjudicated a dependent-
24 neglected juvenile in the same case in which a motion for a change of custody
25 has been filed to remove the juvenile from the custody of a parent, a
26 subsequent adjudication is required if the ground for the removal is not the
27 same as the ground previously adjudicated.
28 (b) If a juvenile is in detention, an adjudication hearing shall be
29 held, unless the juvenile or a party is seeking an extended juvenile
30 jurisdiction designation, not later than fourteen (14) days from the date of

32 for a continuance.
33 (c) In extended juvenile jurisdiction offender proceedings, the
34 adjudication shall be held within the time prescribed by the speedy trial
35 provisions of Rule 28 of the Arkansas Rules of Criminal Procedure.

16 parent, guardian, or custodian and placed with the Department of Human
17 Services or other licensed agency responsible for the care of juveniles or

16 reunification efforts have not been reasonable, but further preventive or
17 reunification efforts could not permit the juvenile to remain safely at home,

19 note the failure by the department in the record of the case.

29 and the public.

31 filed by the court, or by a party or party's attorney as designated by the
32 court, within thirty (30) days of the date of the hearing or prior to the

20 (iii) The burden is on the parent, guardian, or

12 probation was imposed under § 9-27-330.
13 (f)(1) Nonpayment of restitution, fines, or court costs may constitute

17 effort to obtain the funds required for payment.
18 (2) In determining whether to revoke probation, the court shall

24 fine, costs, or restitution is excusable under subdivision (f)(1) of this
25 section, the court may enter an order allowing the juvenile additional time
26 for payment, reducing the amount of each installment, or revoking the fine,
27 costs, or restitution or unpaid portion thereof in whole or in part.

9 juvenile's life in all instances in which the return of a juvenile to the

8 including consideration of the following factors:
9 (i) The likelihood that the juvenile will be adopted
10 if the termination petition is granted; and
11 (ii) The potential harm, specifically addressing the
12 effect on the health and safety of the child, caused by returning the child
13 to the custody of the parent, parents, or putative parent or parents; and

21 the court to be dependent-neglected and has continued out of the home of the
22 noncustodial parent for twelve (12) months and, despite a meaningful effort

34 (b) To find willful failure to maintain
35 meaningful contact, it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from
36 visiting or having contact with the juvenile by the juvenile's custodian or
115 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 any other person, taking into consideration the distance of the juvenile's
2 placement from the parent's home.

28 which was perpetrated by the juvenile's parent or parents or stepparent or
29 stepparents.
30 (b) Such findings by the juvenile division of
31 circuit court shall constitute grounds for immediate termination of the
32 parental rights of one (1) or both of the parents;
33 (vii)(a) That other factors or issues arose
34 subsequent to the filing of the original petition for dependency-neglect that
35 demonstrate that placement of the juvenile in the custody of the parent is
36 contrary to the juvenile's health, safety, or welfare and that, despite the
116 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320

12 includes, but is not limited to, mental illness, emotional illness, or mental
13 deficiencies.
14 (d) Subdivision (b)(3)(B)(vii)(a) of this
15 section does not apply if the factors or issues have not been adjudicated by
16 the court or the parent is not provided with proper notice of the factors or

23 established.
24 (a) Absent orders of a circuit court or another court of competent
25 jurisdiction to the contrary, the biological mother, whether adult or minor,
26 of a juvenile for whom paternity has not been established is deemed to be the
27 natural guardian of that juvenile and is entitled to the care, custody, and

30 or herself, or the Office of Child Support Enforcement of the Revenue
31 Division of the Department of Finance and Administration may bring an action
32 to establish paternity or support of a juvenile for whom paternity has not
33 been established.
34 (c)(1) If the juvenile is not born when the parties appear before the

121 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 (2) In the event the final order is contrary to the temporary
2 one, the court shall render judgment for the amount paid under the temporary
3 order against the petitioner if such was the biological mother.
4 (3) If the mother dies before the final order, the action may be
5 revived in the name of the juvenile, and the mother's testimony at the
6 temporary hearing may be introduced in the final hearing.
7 (d) Upon an adjudication by the court that the putative father is the
8 father of the juvenile, the court shall follow the same guidelines,
9 procedures, and requirements as established by the laws of this state
10 applicable to child support orders and judgments entered upon divorce. The
11 court may award court costs and attorney's fees.
12 (e) If paternity has been established in a court of competent
13 jurisdiction, a father may petition the court in the county where the
14 juvenile resides for custody of the juvenile. The court may award custody to
15 a father who has had paternity established if the court finds by a
16 preponderance of the evidence that:
17 (1) He is a fit parent to raise the juvenile;
18 (2) He has assumed his responsibilities toward the juvenile by
19 providing care, supervision, protection, and financial support for the
20 juvenile; and
21 (3) It is in the best interest of the juvenile to award custody
22 to the father.
23 (f) At the request of either party in a paternity action, the trial
24 court shall direct that the putative father, biological mother, and juvenile
25 submit to one (1) or more blood tests or other scientific examinations or
26 tests, including deoxyribonucleic acid typing, to determine whether or not
27 the putative father can be excluded as being the father of the juvenile and
28 to establish the probability of paternity if the test does not exclude the
29 putative father.
30 (g) The tests shall be made by a duly qualified physician or
31 physicians, or by another duly qualified person or persons, not to exceed
32 three (3), to be appointed by the court.
33 (h)(1) The results of the tests shall be receivable in evidence.
34 (2)(A) A written report of the test results by the duly
35 qualified expert performing the test, or by a duly qualified expert under
36 whose supervision and direction the test and analysis have been performed,
122 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 certified by an affidavit duly subscribed and sworn to by the expert before a
2 notary public, may be introduced in evidence in illegitimacy actions without
3 calling the expert as a witness. If either party shall desire to question the
4 expert, the party shall have the expert subpoenaed within a reasonable time
5 prior to trial.
6 (B) If the results of the paternity tests establish a
7 ninety-five percent (95%) or more probability of inclusion that the putative
8 father is the biological father of the juvenile and after corroborating
9 testimony of the mother in regard to access during the probable period of
10 conception, this shall constitute a prima facie case of establishment of
11 paternity and the burden of proof shall shift to the putative father to rebut
12 such proof.
13 (3) The experts shall be subject to cross-examination by both
14 parties after the court has caused them to disclose their findings.
15 (i) Whenever the court orders the blood tests to be taken and one (1)
16 of the parties refuses to submit to the test, that fact shall be disclosed
17 upon the trial unless good cause is shown to the contrary.
18 (j) The costs of the test and witness fees shall be taxed by the court
19 as other costs in the case.
20 (k) Whenever it shall be relevant to the prosecution or the defense in
21 a paternity action, blood tests that exclude third parties as the father of
22 the juvenile shall be the same as set out in subsections (f) and (g) of this
23 section.
24 (l) The refusal of a party to submit to a genetic or other ordered
25 test is admissible at a hearing to determine paternity only as to the
26 credibility of the party.
27 (m) If a male witness offers testimony indicating that his act of
28 intercourse with the mother may have resulted in the conception of the
29 juvenile, the court may require the witness to submit to genetic or other
30 tests to determine whether he is the juvenile's father.
31
32 9-27-343. Appeals.
33 (a) All appeals from juvenile cases shall be made to the Supreme Court
34 or to the Court of Appeals in the time and manner provided for appeals in the
35 Arkansas Rules of Appellate Procedure.
36 (b) In delinquency cases, the petitioner may appeal only under those
123 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 circumstances that would permit the state to appeal in criminal proceedings.

3 placement, the juvenile division of circuit court retains jurisdiction to
4 conduct further hearings.
5
6 9-27-344. Monthly report.

8 Administrative Office of the Courts a report in writing upon forms to be

12
13 9-27-345. Admissibility of evidence.
14 (a) Juvenile adjudications of delinquency for offenses for which the
15 juvenile could have been tried as an adult may be used at the sentencing
16 phase in subsequent adult criminal proceedings against those same
17 individuals.
18 (b)(1) No other evidence adduced against a juvenile in any proceeding
19 under this subchapter nor the fact of adjudication or disposition shall be
20 admissible evidence against the juvenile in any civil, criminal, or other
21 proceeding.
22 (2) However, the evidence shall be admissible when proper in
23 subsequent proceedings against the same juvenile under this subchapter.
24
25 9-27-346. Support orders.
26 (a) If it appears at the adjudication or disposition hearing in any
27 case brought under this subchapter that the parents or any other person named
28 in the petition who is by law required to provide support for the juvenile is
29 able to contribute to the support of the juvenile, the court shall issue an
30 order requiring the person to pay a reasonable sum pursuant to the guidelines
31 for child support and the family support chart for the support, maintenance,
32 or education of the juvenile to any person, agency, or institution to whom
33 custody is awarded.
34 (b) The court, upon proper motion, may make such adjustments and
35 modifications of the order as may appear reasonable and proper.
36 (c) The court shall also order the persons required by law to support

12 (2) The report shall contain among other information the age,
13 sex, nativity, residence, education, mentality, habits, whether married or
14 single, and employment and income and shall be continued so as to show the
15 condition of the person during the term of his or her probation and the
16 results of probation in the case.
17 (3) The report shall never be disclosed except as required by
18 law or directed by the court.
19 (c) The probation officer shall furnish to each person released on
20 probation a written statement of the terms and conditions of probation and

7 provide family services;
8 (iii) Whether the parent or parents or person from whom

11 remedying the issues that prevent the safe return of the juvenile;
12 (iv) Whether the case plan is moving toward an
13 appropriate permanency plan under § 9-35-324 for the juvenile;

18 established.
19 (a) Absent an order of a circuit court or another court of competent
20 jurisdiction to the contrary, the biological mother, whether adult or minor,
21 of a juvenile for whom paternity has not been established is:
22 (1) Deemed to be the natural guardian of that juvenile; and
23 (2) Is entitled to the care, custody, and control of that
24 juvenile.
25 (b) The biological mother, the putative father, the juvenile himself
26 or herself, or the Office of Child Support Enforcement may bring an action to
27 establish paternity or support of a juvenile for whom paternity has not been
28 established.
29 (c)(1) If the juvenile is not born when the parties appear before the
30 court, the court may hear evidence and issue temporary orders and findings
31 pending the birth of the juvenile.
32 (2) If the final order is contrary to the temporary one, the
33 court shall render judgment for the amount paid under the temporary order
34 against the petitioner if the petitioner was the biological mother.
35 (3) If the mother dies before the final order, the action may be
36 revived in the name of the juvenile, and the mother's testimony at the
229 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 temporary hearing may be introduced in the final hearing.
2 (d)(1) Upon an adjudication by the court that the putative father is
3 the father of the juvenile, the court shall follow the same guidelines,
4 procedures, and requirements as established by the laws of this state
5 applicable to child support orders and judgments entered upon divorce.
6 (2) The court may award court costs and attorney's fees.
7 (e)(1) If paternity has been established in a court of competent
8 jurisdiction, a father may petition the court in the county where the
9 juvenile resides for custody of the juvenile.
10 (2) The court may award custody to a father who has had
11 paternity established if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence
12 that:
13 (A) He is a fit parent to raise the juvenile;
14 (B) He has assumed his responsibilities toward the
15 juvenile by providing care, supervision, protection, and financial support
16 for the juvenile; and
17 (C) It is in the best interest of the juvenile to award
18 custody to the father.
19 (f) At the request of either party in a paternity action, the trial
20 court shall direct that the putative father, biological mother, and juvenile
21 submit to one (1) or more blood tests or other scientific examinations or
22 tests, including deoxyribonucleic acid typing, to:
23 (1) Determine whether or not the putative father can be excluded
24 as being the father of the juvenile; and
25 (2) Establish the probability of paternity if the test does not
26 exclude the putative father.
27 (g) The tests under subsection (f) of this section shall be made by a
28 duly qualified physician or physicians, or by another duly qualified person
29 or persons, not to exceed three (3), to be appointed by the court.
30 (h)(1) The results of the tests under subsection (f) of this section
31 shall be receivable in evidence.
32 (2)(A)(i) A written report of the test results by the duly
33 qualified expert performing the test, or by a duly qualified expert under
34 whose supervision and direction the test and analysis have been performed,
35 certified by an affidavit duly subscribed and sworn to by the expert before a
36 notary public, may be introduced in evidence in illegitimacy actions without

1 calling the expert as a witness.
2 (ii) If either party desires to question the expert,
3 the party shall have the expert subpoenaed within a reasonable time before
4 trial.
5 (B) If the results of the paternity tests establish a
6 ninety-five percent (95%) or more probability of inclusion that the putative
7 father is the biological father of the juvenile and after corroborating
8 testimony of the mother in regard to access during the probable period of
9 conception, this shall constitute a prima facie case of establishment of
10 paternity and the burden of proof shall shift to the putative father to rebut
11 such proof.
12 (3) The experts shall be subject to cross-examination by both
13 parties after the court has caused them to disclose their findings.
14 (i) Whenever the court orders the blood tests to be taken and one (1)
15 of the parties refuses to submit to the test, that fact shall be disclosed
16 upon the trial unless good cause is shown to the contrary.
17 (j) The costs of the test and witness fees shall be taxed by the court
18 as other costs in the case.
19 (k) Whenever it shall be relevant to the prosecution or the defense in
20 a paternity action, blood tests that exclude third parties as the father of
21 the juvenile shall be the same as set out in subsections (f) and (g) of this
22 section.
23 (l) The refusal of a party to submit to a genetic or other ordered
24 test is admissible at a hearing to determine paternity only as to the
25 credibility of the party.
26 (m) If a male witness offers testimony indicating that his act of
27 intercourse with the mother may have resulted in the conception of the
28 juvenile, the court may require the witness to submit to genetic or other
29 tests to determine whether he is the juvenile's father.

25 (a)(1)(A) An adjudication hearing shall be held to determine whether
26 the allegations in a petition are substantiated by the proof.
27 (B)(i) If the court finds that the juvenile is dependent-

21 emergency and the agency had no prior contact with the family or the child,
22 evidence shall be presented to the court regarding all prior contact between
23 the agency and the juvenile or the family before a finding of reasonable
24 efforts to prevent removal by the department.
25 (3) A finding of reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the
26 juvenile is void if the court determines that the department failed to
27 disclose all prior contact between the agency and juvenile or the family
28 before the finding.

30 within thirty (30) days after the probable cause hearing under § 9-35-310.

24 (c) At any time during the pendency of any case of dependency-neglect
25 in which an out-of-home placement has occurred, any party may request the
26 court to review the case, and the party requesting the hearing shall provide
27 reasonable notice to all parties.
28 (d) At any time during the course of a case, the department, the
29 attorney ad litem, or the court can request a hearing on whether or not
30 reunification services should be terminated under § 9-35-335.

4 (ii) Whether the state has made reasonable efforts
5 to provide family services;
6 (iii) Whether the parent or parents or person from
7 whom custody was removed has demonstrated progress toward the goals of the
8 case plan and whether completion of the goals has benefited the parent in
9 remedying the issues that prevent the safe return of the juvenile;
10 (iv) Whether the case plan is moving toward an
11 appropriate permanency plan under § 9-35-324 for the juvenile;
12 (v) Whether the visitation plan is appropriate for
13 the juvenile, the parent or parents, and any siblings, if separated; and
14 (vi)(a) Whether the juvenile should be returned to
15 his or her parent or parents and whether or not the juvenile's health and
16 safety can be protected by his or her parent or parents if returned home,
17 either permanently or for a trial placement.
18 (b) At any time the court determines that the
19 health and safety of the child can be adequately protected and it is in the
20 best interest of the child, the court shall return the child to a parent or
21 parents from whom custody was removed.
22 (B)(i) The court may order any studies, evaluations, or
23 post-disposition reports, if needed.
24 (ii) All studies, evaluations, or post-disposition

5 for the juvenile, including concurrent planning.
6 (B) Incompletion of the case plan under subdivision
7 (e)(3)(A)(i) of this section is an insufficient reason by itself to deny the
8 juvenile's return to the family home.
9 (f) Each six-month review hearing shall be completed, and the written
10 order under subsection (e) of this section shall be filed by the court or by
11 a party or a party's attorney as designated by the court and distributed to
12 the parties within thirty (30) days of the date of the hearing or before the
13 next hearing, whichever is sooner.

24 commitment to the child and the relative is willing to pursue guardianship or
25 permanent custody; or
26 (b) The juvenile is being cared for by his or

28 (ii) Termination of parental rights is not in the
29 best interest of the juvenile;
30 (B) The department has documented in the case plan a

35 the juvenile, consistent with the time period in the case plan, the services

14 (B) Another planned permanent living arrangement shall be
15 selected only if:
16 (i) The department has documented to the circuit
17 court a compelling reason for determining that it would not be in the best
18 interest of the child to follow one (1) of the permanency plans identified in

20 (ii) The child is sixteen (16) years of age or
21 older; and
22 (iii) The court makes a judicial determination
23 explaining why, as of the date of the hearing, another planned permanent

26 the juvenile to:
27 (a) Return home;

26 Department of Human Services or a court-appointed attorney ad litem.
27 (B) This section shall not be available for private
28 litigants or other agencies.
29 (2)(A) This section shall be used only in cases in which the
30 department is attempting to clear a juvenile for permanent placement by
31 terminating the parental rights of a parent and putative parent based on the
32 definition of “parent” and “putative father” under § 9-35-102.
33 (B) This section shall not be used to terminate the rights
34 of a putative parent if a court of competent jurisdiction has previously
35 determined under § 9-35-314 that the rights of the putative parent have not
36 attached.
283 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 (3) The intent of this section is to provide permanency in a
2 juvenile's life in all instances in which the return of a juvenile to the
3 family home is contrary to the juvenile's health, safety, or welfare and it
4 appears from the evidence that a return to the family home cannot be
5 accomplished in a reasonable period of time as viewed from the juvenile's
6 perspective.
7 (4) The court shall rely upon the record of the parent's
8 compliance in the entire dependency-neglect case and evidence presented at
9 the termination hearing in making its decision on whether it is in the best
10 interest of the juvenile to terminate parental rights.
11 (b)(1)(A) The circuit court may consider a petition to terminate
12 parental rights if the court finds that there is an appropriate permanency
13 placement plan for the juvenile.
14 (B) This section does not require that a permanency
15 planning hearing be held as a prerequisite to the filing of a petition to
16 terminate parental rights or as a prerequisite to the court's considering a
17 petition to terminate parental rights.
18 (2)(A) The petitioner shall serve the petition to terminate
19 parental rights as required under Rule 5 of the Arkansas Rules of Civil
20 Procedure, except:
21 (i) Service shall be made as required under Rule 4

24 Arkansas Rules of Civil Procedure at the initiation of the proceeding;
25 (b) Parent is not represented by an attorney;
26 or
27 (c) Initiation of the proceeding was more than
28 two (2) years ago; or
29 (ii) When the court orders service of the petition to
30 terminate parental rights as required under Rule 4 of the Arkansas Rules of
31 Civil Procedure.
32 (B) The petitioner shall check with the Putative Father
33 Registry if the name or whereabouts of the putative father is unknown.
34 (3) An order forever terminating parental rights shall be based
35 upon a finding by clear and convincing evidence:
36 (A) That it is in the best interest of the juvenile,
284 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 including consideration of the following factors:
2 (i) The likelihood that the juvenile will be adopted
3 if the termination petition is granted; and
4 (ii) The potential harm, specifically addressing the
5 effect on the health and safety of the child, caused by returning the child
6 to the custody of the parent, parents, or putative parent or parents; and
7 (B) Of one (1) or more of the following grounds:
8 (i)(a) That a juvenile has been adjudicated by the
9 court to be dependent-neglected and has continued to be out of the:
10 (1) Custody of the parent for twelve
11 (12) months and, despite a meaningful effort by the department to
12 rehabilitate the parent and correct the conditions that caused removal, those
13 conditions have not been remedied by the parent; or
14 (2) Home of the noncustodial parent for
15 twelve (12) months and, despite a meaningful effort by the department to
16 rehabilitate the parent and correct the conditions that prevented the child
17 from safely being placed in the parent's home, the conditions have not been
18 remedied by the parent.
19 (b) It is not necessary that the twelve-month
20 period referenced in subdivision (b)(3)(B)(i)(a)(1) of this section
21 immediately precede the filing of the petition for termination of parental
22 rights or that it be for twelve (12) consecutive months;
23 (ii)(a) The juvenile has lived outside the
24 home of the parent for a period of twelve (12) months, and the parent has
25 willfully failed to provide significant material support in accordance with
26 the parent's means or to maintain meaningful contact with the juvenile.
27 (b) To find willful failure to maintain
28 meaningful contact, it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from
29 visiting or having contact with the juvenile by the juvenile's custodian or
30 any other person, taking into consideration the distance of the juvenile's
31 placement from the parent's home.
32 (c) Material support consists of either
33 financial contributions or food, shelter, clothing, or other necessities when
34 the contribution has been requested by the juvenile's custodian or ordered by
35 a court of competent jurisdiction.
36 (d) It is not necessary that the twelve-month
285 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320

2 the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights or that it be
3 for twelve (12) consecutive months;
4 (iii)(a) The parent is not the biological
5 parent of the juvenile and the welfare of the juvenile can best be served by
6 terminating the parental rights of the parent.
7 (b) A termination of parental rights
8 under subdivision (b)(3)(B)(iii)(a) of this section shall not be considered
9 an involuntary termination;
10 (iv) A parent has abandoned the juvenile;
11 (v)(a) A parent has executed consent to termination
12 of parental rights or adoption of the juvenile, subject to the court's
13 approval.
14 (b) If the consent is executed under oath by a
15 person authorized to administer the oath, the parent is not required to
16 execute the consent in the presence of the court unless required by federal
17 law or federal regulations;
18 (vi)(a) The court has found the juvenile or a
19 sibling dependent-neglected as a result of neglect or abuse that could
20 endanger the life of the child, sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, any of
21 which was perpetrated by the juvenile's parent or parents or stepparent or
22 stepparents.
23 (b) Such findings by the juvenile division of
24 circuit court shall constitute grounds for immediate termination of the
25 parental rights of one (1) or both of the parents;
26 (vii)(a) That other factors or issues arose
27 subsequent to the filing of the original petition for dependency-neglect that
28 demonstrate that placement of the juvenile in the custody of the parent is
29 contrary to the juvenile's health, safety, or welfare and that, despite the
30 offer of appropriate family services, the parent has manifested the
31 incapacity or indifference to remedy the subsequent issues or factors or
32 rehabilitate the parent's circumstances that prevent the placement of the
33 juvenile in the custody of the parent.
34 (b) The department shall make reasonable
35 accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of
36 1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., as it existed on January 1, 2025, to parents

5 includes, but is not limited to, mental illness, emotional illness, or mental
6 deficiencies.
7 (d) Subdivision (b)(3)(B)(vii)(a) of this
8 section does not apply if the factors or issues have not been adjudicated by
9 the court or the parent is not provided with proper notice of the factors or
10 issues;
11 (viii) The parent is sentenced in a criminal
12 proceeding for a period of time that would constitute a substantial period of
13 the juvenile's life;
14 (ix)(a) The parent is found by a court of competent
15 jurisdiction, including the juvenile division of the circuit court, to:

2 endanger the life of the child;
3 (4)(A) Have had his or her parental
4 rights involuntarily terminated as to a child.

23 (b) To find willful failure to maintain
24 meaningful contact, it shall be shown that the putative parent was not
25 prevented from visiting or having contact with the juvenile by the custodian
26 of the juvenile or any other person, taking into consideration the distance
27 of the juvenile's placement from the putative parent's home.
28 (c) A termination of parental rights under
29 subdivision (b)(3)(B)(x)(a) of this section shall not be considered an
30 involuntary termination.
31 (d)(1) Subdivision (b)(3)(B)(x)(a) of this
32 section does not apply to a putative parent whose rights have not attached to
33 a juvenile.
34 (2) If a court finds that the rights of

11 juvenile by providing care, supervision, protection, and financial support
12 for the juvenile; and
13 (C) It is in the best interest of the juvenile to award

22 exclude the putative father.
23 (g) The tests under subsection (f) of this section shall be made by a

1 (B) If the results of the paternity tests establish a
2 ninety-five percent (95%) or more probability of inclusion that the putative
3 father is the biological father of the juvenile and after corroborating
4 testimony of the mother in regard to access during the probable period of
5 conception, this shall constitute a prima facie case of establishment of
6 paternity and the burden of proof shall shift to the putative father to rebut
7 such proof.
8 (3) The experts shall be subject to cross-examination by both
9 parties after the court has caused them to disclose their findings.

21 credibility of the party.
22 (m) If a male witness offers testimony indicating that his act of
23 intercourse with the mother may have resulted in the conception of the
24 juvenile, the court may require the witness to submit to genetic or other
25 tests to determine whether he is the juvenile's father.

12 SECTION 66. DO NOT CODIFY. Construction.
13 (a) The enactment and adoption of this act shall not expressly or
14 impliedly repeal an act passed during the regular session of the Ninety-Fifth
15 General Assembly.
16 (b) To the extent that a conflict exists between an act of the regular
17 session of the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly and this act:
18 (1) The act of the regular session of the Ninety-Fifth General
19 Assembly shall be treated as a subsequent act passed by the General Assembly
20 for the purposes of:
21 (A) Giving the act of the regular session of the Ninety-
22 Fifth General Assembly its full force and effect; and
23 (B) Amending or repealing the appropriate parts of the
24 Arkansas Code of 1987; and
25 (2) Section 1-2-107 shall not apply.
26
27 SECTION 67. DO NOT CODIFY. Incorporation of legislation into
28 recodified Arkansas Juvenile Code and related amendments.
29 (a) For purposes of incorporation into the recodified Arkansas
30 Juvenile Code created by this act and related amendments to the Arkansas Code
31 made in connection with the recodification of the Arkansas Juvenile Code, all
32 references in the acts passed at the regular session of the Ninety-Fifth
33 General Assembly to the Arkansas Juvenile Code of 1989 or to provisions of
34 the Arkansas Code amended by this act in connection with the recodification
35 of the Arkansas Juvenile Code shall be deemed to refer to the applicable or
36 corresponding provisions contained in the recodified Arkansas Juvenile Code
390 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 and related amendments to the Arkansas Code made in connection with the
2 recodification of the Arkansas Juvenile Code.
3 (b) The Bureau of Legislative Research, while assisting the Arkansas
4 Code Revision Commission with the commission's powers and duties, shall:
5 (1) Incorporate acts passed in the regular session of the
6 Ninety-Fifth General Assembly amending the Arkansas Juvenile Code of 1989 or
7 to provisions of the Arkansas Code amended by this act in connection with the
8 recodification of the Arkansas Juvenile Code into the appropriate provisions
9 of the Arkansas Code so long as those revisions do not result in a change in
10 the substance or meaning of a provision of the act; and
11 (2) Make technical changes to the Arkansas Code necessary to
12 implement this act, including without limitation changes to citations in the
13 Arkansas Code referencing provisions of Arkansas law amended by this act.
14
15 SECTION 68. DO NOT CODIFY. Technical revisions to Code of Arkansas
16 Rules.
17 (a) The General Assembly finds that, as a result of the recodification
18 of the Arkansas Juvenile Code and other amendments to the Arkansas Code under
19 this act, multiple statutory references to the Arkansas Juvenile Code or
20 other provisions of Arkansas law in the Code of Arkansas Rules will be
21 incorrect and require revision to reflect the changes implemented by this
22 act.
23 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that these provisions of
24 the Code of Arkansas Rules be updated by the Bureau of Legislative Research
25 as part of its maintenance of the Code of Arkansas Rules.
26 (c) The bureau shall update statutory references to the Arkansas
27 Juvenile Code of 1989 or other provisions of Arkansas law in the Code of
28 Arkansas Rules to reflect the proper citations under this act.
29 (d) Any person or state entity identifying one (1) or more citations
30 contained in the Code of Arkansas Rules that require revision to implement
31 this act may notify the Director of the Bureau of Legislative Research or his
32 or her designee of the citations at issue.
33
34 SECTION 69. DO NOT CODIFY. Correction of technical errors related to
35 implementation of recodification of the Arkansas Juvenile Code.
36 (a)(1) The General Assembly finds that:
391 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 (A) The implementation of this act involves a multitude of
2 changes to existing Arkansas law;
3 (B) Many of the changes implemented by this act are highly
4 technical and require careful study of the purpose and context of each
5 Arkansas Code section, with the need for some of the changes not becoming
6 apparent until after the implementation of this act;
7 (C) When implementing revisions as large and comprehensive
8 as the changes under this act, it is inevitable that certain sections of the
9 Arkansas Code requiring technical changes to follow the intent of this act
10 will be either omitted or amended in a manner that is later found to be
11 erroneous and unintentional;
12 (D) It is likewise inevitable that other acts enacted by
13 the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly will not take into account the changes in
14 this act, resulting in technical inconsistencies between newly passed laws;
15 and
16 (E) If the correct statutory change to remedy an
17 unintentional error or an inconsistency between this act and another act of
18 the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly is readily apparent and consistent with the
19 intent of this act, the unintentional error or inconsistency should be
20 corrected as part of the codification process due to the technical nature of
21 the unintentional error or inconsistency.
22 (2) It is the intent of the General Assembly to empower the
23 Arkansas Code Revision Commission to correct technical errors identified in
24 the Arkansas Code during the implementation of this act to allow this act to
25 be fully implemented.
26 (b)(1)(A) Any person or state entity identifying one (1) or more
27 sections of the Arkansas Code that require revision to implement the intent
28 of this act may notify the Director of the Bureau of Legislative Research or
29 his or her designee of the section or sections at issue.
30 (B) If the Bureau of Legislative Research, while assisting
31 the commission with the commission's powers and duties, becomes aware of one
32 (1) or more sections of the Arkansas Code that require revision to implement
33 the intent of this act for which it appears that the bureau and the
34 commission do not have authority to make the necessary revision under § 1-2-
35 303(d), the bureau may notify the commission of the section or sections at
36 issue.
392 03-19-2025 12:14:20 LJH010

As Engrossed: H3/19/25 SB320
1 (2) If the commission determines that the revision necessary to
2 one (1) or more sections of the Arkansas Code under subdivision (b)(1) of
3 this section is technical in nature, germane to the intent of this act, and
4 consistent with this act's policy and purposes, the commission may make the
5 revision to the Arkansas Code.
6 (3) The commission shall notify the publisher of the Arkansas
7 Code of a revision to the Arkansas Code under subdivision (b)(2) of this
8 section as soon as possible so that the revision may be reflected in the
9 official hard copy version of the Arkansas Code and the official electronic
10 version of the Arkansas Code.
11 (4)(A) Except as provided in subdivision (b)(4)(B) of this
12 section, when the commission approves a revision to the Arkansas Code under
13 subdivision (b)(2) of this section, the commission shall notify the following
14 of the revision within thirty (30) days:
15 (i) The Speaker of the House of Representatives;
16 (ii) The President Pro Tempore of the Senate; and
17 (iii) The Legislative Council.
18 (B) The commission is not required to make a notification
19 under subdivision (b)(4)(A) of this section if the revision is made under §
20 1-2-303(d).
21 (c) The authority granted to the commission under this section is
22 supplemental to the commission's authority under § 1-2-303.
23 (d) This section shall expire on December 31, 2026.
