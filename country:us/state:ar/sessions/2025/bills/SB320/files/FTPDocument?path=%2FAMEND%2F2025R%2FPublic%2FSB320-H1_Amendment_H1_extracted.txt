LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 105 of 237
(a)(1) The Department of Human Services shall make diligent efforts to
identify putative parents in a dependency-neglect proceeding, including
without limitation checking the Putative Father Registry.
(b)(1)(A) If the petitioner has named and served a putative parent
under this section and § 9-35-306, the court shall resolve the:
(i) Party status of a putative parent; and
(ii) Rights of the putative parent as a putative
father, if the putative father's rights have attached.
(B) A court may consider the termination of the rights of
a putative parent under § 9-35-325 if the:

(3)(A) The court may order deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing
at any time.
(B) A court may establish paternity or determine whether a
putative parent is a parent as defined under § 9-35-102 regardless of whether
a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test was ordered or performed.
(C) If there is more than one (1) putative parent of the
juvenile, the court shall order a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test of each
identified putative parent to determine the biological parent of the
juvenile.
(D) A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test establishing a
putative parent as the biological parent of a juvenile is sufficient evidence
for the court to:
(i) Adjudicate paternity;
(ii) Establish that the putative parent is a parent
for the purposes of this subchapter; and
(iii) Enter a decree of paternity.
(4) A putative parent has the burden to prove paternity and
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 106 of 237
significant contacts with the juvenile.
(c)(1) Except as provided under § 9-35-306, a putative parent shall be
named as a party if the circuit court:
(A)(i) Has determined that the putative parent has
established paternity; and
(ii) Enters an order establishing the putative
parent as a parent for the purposes of this subchapter and directing that the
parent be added to the case as a party defendant; or
(B)(i) Has determined that the putative parent has
established significant contacts with the juvenile; and
(ii) Enters an order finding that the rights of the
putative parent have attached and directing that the parent shall be added to
the case as a party defendant.
(2)(A) If the petitioner has named and served a putative parent
under this section and § 9-35-306 and the circuit court finds that the
putative parent has established paternity, the court shall:
(i) Enter an order establishing the putative parent
as a parent for the purposes of this subchapter; and
(ii) Maintain the parent as a party defendant.
(B) If the petitioner has named and served a putative
parent under this section and § 9-35-306 and the circuit court finds that the
putative parent has established significant contacts with the juvenile, the
court shall:
(i) Enter an order stating that the rights of the
putative parent have attached; and
(ii) Maintain the putative parent as a party
defendant.
(3) If the circuit court finds that the putative parent, after
being given notice and opportunity to be heard, has not established paternity
or significant contacts with the juvenile, the circuit court shall:
(A) Find that the:
(i) Putative parent is not a parent for the purposes
of this subchapter; and
(ii) Rights of the putative parent have not attached;
and
(B) Dismiss the putative parent from the case and enter an
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 107 of 237
order finding that no further notice, including without limitation notice of

to § 9-35-311.
9-35-315. Family time.

parent if:
(A) The court determines that the health and safety of the
juvenile can be adequately protected; and
(B) It is in the best interest of the child.
(2) Unless the court has restricted unsupervised family time,
the Department of Human Services may allow unsupervised family time between a
juvenile and a parent at any time.
(b)(1) The petitioner has the burden of proving at every hearing that
unsupervised family time is not in the best interest of a child.
(2) If the court determines that unsupervised family time
between a juvenile and a parent is not in the best interest of the child,
family time between the juvenile and the parent shall be supervised.
(c)(1) A rebuttable presumption that unsupervised family time is in
the best interest of the juvenile applies at every hearing.
(2) The burden of proof to rebut the presumption in subdivision
(c)(1) of this section is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
(d) The court may consider the preferences of the juvenile regarding
family time if the juvenile is of a sufficient age and capacity to reason,
regardless of the juvenile's chronological age.
(e)(1) If the court orders supervised family time, the parent from
whom custody of the juvenile has been removed shall receive a minimum of four
(4) hours of supervised family time per week.
(2) The court may order less than four (4) hours of supervised
family time if the court determines that the supervised family time:
(A) Is not in the best interest of the juvenile; or
(B) Will impose an extreme hardship on one (1) of the
parties.
(f)(1) A parent testing positive for a drug on a drug test is an
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 108 of 237
insufficient reason to deny the parent family time with the juvenile if the
court has ordered family time between the parent and a juvenile.
(2) Family time that was ordered by the court may be canceled
if, at the time that family time between the parent and a juvenile occurs,
the parent:
(A) Is under the influence of drugs or alcohol;

(A) Background check; and
(B) Child maltreatment registry check; and
(3) The relative or fictive kin meets the driving requirements
established by the department.
9-35-316. Adjudication hearing.
(a)(1)(A) An adjudication hearing shall be held to determine whether
the allegations in a petition are substantiated by the proof.
(B)(i) If the court finds that the juvenile is dependent-
neglected, the court shall determine whether a noncustodial parent
contributed to the dependency-neglect and whether the noncustodial parent is
a fit parent for purposes of custody or family time.
(ii) A noncustodial parent in subdivision
(a)(1)(B)(i) of this section is presumed to be a fit parent.
(iii)(a) If no earlier court order has been entered
into evidence concerning custody or family time with the noncustodial parent
of the juvenile subject to the dependency-neglect petition, the petitioner
shall, and any party may, provide evidence to the court whether the
noncustodial parent is unfit for purposes of custody or family time.
(b) The petitioner shall provide evidence as
to whether the noncustodial parent contributed to the dependency-neglect.
(iv)(a) The court may transfer temporary custody or
permanent custody to the noncustodial parent after a review of evidence and a
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 109 of 237
finding that it is in the best interest of the juvenile to transfer custody,
or the court may order family time with the noncustodial parent.
(b) An order of transfer of custody to the
noncustodial parent does not relieve the Department of Human Services of the
responsibility to provide services to the parent from whom custody was
removed, unless the court enters an order to relieve the department of the
responsibility.
(c) A home study is not required to transfer
custody to a parent of the juvenile.
(v) If the court determines that the child cannot
safely be placed in the custody of the noncustodial parent, the court shall
make specific findings of fact regarding the safety factors that need to be
corrected by the noncustodial parent before placement or family time with the
juvenile.
(2) Unless the court finds that a removal occurred due to an
emergency and the agency had no prior contact with the family or the child,
evidence shall be presented to the court regarding all prior contact between
the agency and the juvenile or the family before a finding of reasonable
efforts to prevent removal by the department.
(3) A finding of reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the
juvenile is void if the court determines that the department failed to
disclose all prior contact between the agency and juvenile or the family
before the finding.
(4)(A) The dependency-neglect adjudication hearing shall be held
within thirty (30) days after the probable cause hearing under § 9-35-310.
(B) On a motion of the court or any party, the court may
continue the adjudication hearing up to sixty (60) days after the removal
for good cause shown.

(5) If the juvenile has previously been adjudicated a dependent-
neglected juvenile in the same case in which a motion for a change of custody
has been filed to remove the juvenile from the custody of a parent, a
subsequent adjudication is required if the ground for the removal is not the
same as the ground previously adjudicated.
(b)(1) Following an adjudication in which a juvenile is found to be
dependent-neglected, the court may order any studies, evaluations, or
predisposition reports, if needed, that bear on disposition.
(2)(A) All reports under subdivision (b)(1) of this section
shall be provided in writing to all parties and counsel at least two (2) days
before the disposition hearing.
(B) All parties shall be given a fair opportunity to
controvert any parts of reports under subdivision (b)(1) of this section.

(a)(1) A juvenile who is alleged to be or who has been adjudicated
either dependent-neglected or a member of a family in need of services shall
not be placed or detained in a secure detention facility, in a facility
utilized for the detention of alleged or adjudicated delinquent juveniles, or
in a facility utilized for the detention of adults held for, charged with, or
convicted of a crime except that a juvenile may be held in a juvenile

person contacted lives in the state or twenty-four (24) hours, excluding
weekends and holidays, if the parent, guardian, or other person contacted
lives out of state.
9-35-318. Removal of juvenile.
(a) Before a circuit court may order any dependent-neglected juvenile
or family in need of services juvenile removed from the custody of his or her
parent, guardian, or custodian and placed with the Department of Human
Services or other licensed agency responsible for the care of juveniles or
with a relative or other individual, the court shall order family services
appropriate to prevent removal unless the health and safety of the juvenile
warrant immediate removal for the protection of the juvenile.
(b) When the court orders a dependent-neglected juvenile removed from
the custody of a parent, guardian, or custodian and placed in the custody of
the department or other licensed agency responsible for the care of juveniles
or with a relative or other individual, the court shall make these specific
findings in the order:
(1) In the initial order of removal, the court must find

remain at home;
(B) The removal and the reasons for the removal of the
juvenile is necessary to protect the health and safety of the juvenile; and

LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 112 of 237
(B) What efforts were made to provide those family
services relevant to the needs of the family before the removal of the
juvenile, taking into consideration whether or not the juvenile could safely
remain at home while family services were provided;
(C) Why efforts made to provide the family services
described did not prevent the removal of the juvenile; and
(D) Whether efforts made to prevent the removal of the
juvenile were reasonable, based upon the needs of the family and the
juvenile.
(c) When the state agency's first contact with the family has occurred
during an emergency in which the juvenile could not safely remain at home,
even with reasonable services being provided, the responsible state agency
shall be deemed to have made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the
need for removal.
(d) When the court finds that the department's preventive or
reunification efforts have not been reasonable, but further preventive or
reunification efforts could not permit the juvenile to remain safely at home,
the court may authorize or continue the removal of the juvenile but shall
note the failure by the department in the record of the case.
(e)(1) In all instances of removal of a juvenile from the home of his
or her parent, guardian, or custodian by a court, the court shall set forth

(C) The findings required by this section.
(2) The written findings and order shall be filed by the court
or by a party or party's attorney as designated by the court within thirty
(30) days of the date of the hearing at which removal is ordered or prior to

the court shall issue an order containing the following determinations
regarding the educational issues of the child and whether the parent or
guardian of the child may:
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 113 of 237
(A) Have access to the child's school records;
(B) Obtain information on the current placement of the
child, including the name and address of the child's foster parent or
provider, if the parent or guardian has access to the child's school records;
and
(C) Participate in school conferences or similar
activities at the child's school.
(2) If the court transfers custody of a child to the department,
the court may appoint an individual to consent to an initial evaluation of
the child and serve as the child's surrogate parent under the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., as it existed on
January 1, 2025.

(2)(A) If it is in the best interest of the juvenile, transfer
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 114 of 237

licensed agency responsible for the care of juveniles, or to a relative or
other individual.
(B) If the court grants custody of the juvenile to the
department, the juvenile shall be placed in a licensed or approved foster
home, shelter, or facility, or an exempt child welfare agency as defined
under § 9-28-402.
(C) A juvenile in the custody of the department is
“awaiting foster care placement”, as that term is used in the definition of
“homeless children and youths” in the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act,
42 U.S.C. § 11434a(2), as it existed on January 1, 2025, if the juvenile:

placement is in the best interest of the juvenile.
(2) A home study is not required for a parent of a juvenile.
(e)(1)(A) The court shall enter an order transferring custody of a

home placement exists.
(B) The juvenile's health and safety shall be the
paramount concern of the court in determining if the department could have
made reasonable efforts to prevent the juvenile's removal.
(2) If the court finds that reasonable efforts to deliver family
services could have been made with the juvenile safely remaining at home but
were not made, the court may:
(A) Dismiss the petition;

terminating the parental rights of a parent and putative parent based on the
definition of “parent” and “putative father” under § 9-35-102.
(B) This section shall not be used to terminate the rights
of a putative parent if a court of competent jurisdiction has previously
determined under § 9-35-314 that the rights of the putative parent have not
attached.
(3) The intent of this section is to provide permanency in a
juvenile's life in all instances in which the return of a juvenile to the
family home is contrary to the juvenile's health, safety, or welfare and it
appears from the evidence that a return to the family home cannot be
accomplished in a reasonable period of time as viewed from the juvenile's
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 127 of 237
perspective.
(4) The court shall rely upon the record of the parent's
compliance in the entire dependency-neglect case and evidence presented at
the termination hearing in making its decision on whether it is in the best

parental rights if the court finds that there is an appropriate permanency
placement plan for the juvenile.

including consideration of the following factors:
(i) The likelihood that the juvenile will be adopted
if the termination petition is granted; and
(ii) The potential harm, specifically addressing the
effect on the health and safety of the child, caused by returning the child
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 128 of 237
to the custody of the parent, parents, or putative parent or parents; and
(B) Of one (1) or more of the following grounds:
(i)(a) That a juvenile has been adjudicated by the
court to be dependent-neglected and has continued to be out of the:

(12) months and, despite a meaningful effort by the department to
rehabilitate the parent and correct the conditions that caused removal, those
conditions have not been remedied by the parent; or
(2) Home of the noncustodial parent for
twelve (12) months and, despite a meaningful effort by the department to
rehabilitate the parent and correct the conditions that prevented the child
from safely being placed in the parent's home, the conditions have not been
remedied by the parent.
(b) It is not necessary that the twelve-month
period referenced in subdivision (b)(3)(B)(i)(a)(1) of this section
immediately precede the filing of the petition for termination of parental
rights or that it be for twelve (12) consecutive months;
(ii)(a) The juvenile has lived outside the
home of the parent for a period of twelve (12) months, and the parent has
willfully failed to provide significant material support in accordance with
the parent's means or to maintain meaningful contact with the juvenile.
(b) To find willful failure to maintain
meaningful contact, it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from
visiting or having contact with the juvenile by the juvenile's custodian or
any other person, taking into consideration the distance of the juvenile's
placement from the parent's home.
(c) Material support consists of either
financial contributions or food, shelter, clothing, or other necessities when
the contribution has been requested by the juvenile's custodian or ordered by
a court of competent jurisdiction.
(d) It is not necessary that the twelve-month
period under subdivision (b)(3)(B)(ii)(a) of this section immediately precede
the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights or that it be
for twelve (12) consecutive months;
(iii)(a) The parent is not the biological
parent of the juvenile and the welfare of the juvenile can best be served by
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 129 of 237
terminating the parental rights of the parent.

sibling dependent-neglected as a result of neglect or abuse that could
endanger the life of the child, sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, any of
which was perpetrated by the juvenile's parent or parents or stepparent or
stepparents.
(b) Such findings by the juvenile division of
circuit court shall constitute grounds for immediate termination of the
parental rights of one (1) or both of the parents;
(vii)(a) That other factors or issues arose
subsequent to the filing of the original petition for dependency-neglect that
demonstrate that placement of the juvenile in the custody of the parent is
contrary to the juvenile's health, safety, or welfare and that, despite the
offer of appropriate family services, the parent has manifested the
incapacity or indifference to remedy the subsequent issues or factors or
rehabilitate the parent's circumstances that prevent the placement of the
juvenile in the custody of the parent.
(b) The department shall make reasonable
accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., as it existed on January 1, 2025, to parents

for the juvenile; and
(C) It is in the best interest of the juvenile to award
custody to the father.
(f) At the request of either party in a paternity action, the trial
court shall direct that the putative father, biological mother, and juvenile
submit to one (1) or more blood tests or other scientific examinations or

(1) Determine whether or not the putative father can be excluded
as being the father of the juvenile; and
(2) Establish the probability of paternity if the test does not

expert, the party shall have the expert subpoenaed within a reasonable time
before trial.
(B) If the results of the paternity tests establish a
ninety-five percent (95%) or more probability of inclusion that the putative
father is the biological father of the juvenile and after corroborating
testimony of the mother in regard to access during the probable period of
conception, this shall constitute a prima facie case of establishment of
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 136 of 237
paternity and the burden of proof shall shift to the putative father to rebut
such proof.
(3) The experts shall be subject to cross-examination by both
parties after the court has caused them to disclose their findings.

of the parties refuses to submit to the test, that fact shall be disclosed
upon the trial unless good cause is shown to the contrary.
(j) The costs of the test and witness fees shall be taxed by the court
as other costs in the case.

a paternity action, blood tests that exclude third parties as the father of
the juvenile shall be the same as set out in subsections (f) and (g) of this

Section 68:
section.
(l) The refusal of a party to submit to a genetic or other ordered
test is admissible at a hearing to determine paternity only as to the
credibility of the party.

juvenile, the court may require the witness to submit to genetic or other
tests to determine whether he is the juvenile's father.

for the juvenile; and

court shall direct that the putative father, biological mother, and juvenile
submit to one (1) or more blood tests or other scientific examinations or
tests, including deoxyribonucleic acid typing, to:
(1) Determine whether or not the putative father can be excluded
as being the father of the juvenile; and

calling the expert as a witness.
(ii) If either party shall desire to question the
expert, the party shall have the expert subpoenaed within a reasonable time
before trial.
(B) If the results of the paternity tests establish a
ninety-five percent (95%) or more probability of inclusion that the putative
father is the biological father of the juvenile and after corroborating
testimony of the mother in regard to access during the probable period of
conception, this shall constitute a prima facie case of establishment of
paternity and the burden of proof shall shift to the putative father to rebut
the proof.
(3) The experts shall be subject to cross-examination by both
parties after the court has caused them to disclose their findings.
(i) When the court orders the blood tests to be taken and one (1) of
the parties refuses to submit to the test, that fact shall be disclosed upon

be taxed by the court as other costs in the case.

Section 82:
section.

test is admissible at a hearing to determine paternity only as to the
credibility of the party.

was not attributable to a purposeful refusal to obey the sentence of the
court or was not due to a failure on his or her part to make a good faith
effort to obtain the funds required for payment.
(2) In determining whether to revoke probation, the court shall
consider the juvenile's employment status, earning ability, financial
resources, the willfulness of the juvenile's failure to pay, and any other

pay.

fine, costs, or restitution is excusable under subdivision (f)(1) of this

as the changes under this act, it is inevitable that certain sections of the
Arkansas Code requiring technical changes to follow the intent of this act
will be either omitted or amended in a manner that is later found to be
erroneous and unintentional;
(D) It is likewise inevitable that other acts enacted by
the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly will not take into account the changes in
this act, resulting in technical inconsistencies between newly passed laws;
and
(E) If the correct statutory change to remedy an
unintentional error or an inconsistency between this act and another act of
the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly is readily apparent and consistent with the
intent of this act, the unintentional error or inconsistency should be
corrected as part of the codification process due to the technical nature of
the unintentional error or inconsistency.
(2) It is the intent of the General Assembly to empower the
Arkansas Code Revision Commission to correct technical errors identified in
the Arkansas Code during the implementation of this act to allow this act to
be fully implemented.
(b)(1)(A) Any person or state entity identifying one (1) or more

Section 116:
sections of the Arkansas Code that require revision to implement the intent
of this act may notify the Director of the Bureau of Legislative Research or
his or her designee of the section or sections at issue.
(B) If the Bureau of Legislative Research, while assisting
the commission with the commission's powers and duties, becomes aware of one
(1) or more sections of the Arkansas Code that require revision to implement
the intent of this act for which it appears that the bureau and the
commission do not have authority to make the necessary revision under § 1-2-
303(d), the bureau may notify the commission of the section or sections at
issue.
(2) If the commission determines that the revision necessary to
one (1) or more sections of the Arkansas Code under subdivision (b)(1) of
this section is technical in nature, germane to the intent of this act, and
consistent with this act's policy and purposes, the commission may make the
revision to the Arkansas Code.
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 236 of 237
(3) The commission shall notify the publisher of the Arkansas
Code of a revision to the Arkansas Code under subdivision (b)(2) of this

Section 117:
section as soon as possible so that the revision may be reflected in the
official hard copy version of the Arkansas Code and the official electronic
version of the Arkansas Code.
(4)(A) Except as provided in subdivision (b)(4)(B) of this

Section 118:
section, when the commission approves a revision to the Arkansas Code under
subdivision (b)(2) of this section, the commission shall notify the following
of the revision within thirty (30) days:
(i) The Speaker of the House of Representatives;
(ii) The President Pro Tempore of the Senate; and
(iii) The Legislative Council.
(B) The commission is not required to make a notification
under subdivision (b)(4)(A) of this section if the revision is made under §
1-2-303(d).
(c) The authority granted to the commission under this section is
supplemental to the commission's authority under § 1-2-303.
(d) This section shall expire on December 31, 2026."

LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 105 of 237

(a)(1) The Department of Human Services shall make diligent efforts to
identify putative parents in a dependency-neglect proceeding, including
without limitation checking the Putative Father Registry.
(b)(1)(A) If the petitioner has named and served a putative parent
under this section and § 9-35-306, the court shall resolve the:
(i) Party status of a putative parent; and
(ii) Rights of the putative parent as a putative
father, if the putative father's rights have attached.
(B) A court may consider the termination of the rights of
a putative parent under § 9-35-325 if the:
(i) Court finds that the putative parent has
established significant contacts; and
(ii) Rights of the putative parent as a putative
father have attached.
(2) The court shall provide a putative parent the opportunity to
be heard regarding his or her:

(3)(A) The court may order deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing
at any time.
(B) A court may establish paternity or determine whether a
putative parent is a parent as defined under § 9-35-102 regardless of whether
a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test was ordered or performed.
(C) If there is more than one (1) putative parent of the
juvenile, the court shall order a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test of each
identified putative parent to determine the biological parent of the
juvenile.
(D) A deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test establishing a
putative parent as the biological parent of a juvenile is sufficient evidence
for the court to:
(i) Adjudicate paternity;
(ii) Establish that the putative parent is a parent
for the purposes of this subchapter; and
(iii) Enter a decree of paternity.
(4) A putative parent has the burden to prove paternity and
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 106 of 237

significant contacts with the juvenile.
(c)(1) Except as provided under § 9-35-306, a putative parent shall be
named as a party if the circuit court:
(A)(i) Has determined that the putative parent has
established paternity; and
(ii) Enters an order establishing the putative
parent as a parent for the purposes of this subchapter and directing that the
parent be added to the case as a party defendant; or
(B)(i) Has determined that the putative parent has
established significant contacts with the juvenile; and
(ii) Enters an order finding that the rights of the
putative parent have attached and directing that the parent shall be added to
the case as a party defendant.
(2)(A) If the petitioner has named and served a putative parent
under this section and § 9-35-306 and the circuit court finds that the
putative parent has established paternity, the court shall:
(i) Enter an order establishing the putative parent
as a parent for the purposes of this subchapter; and
(ii) Maintain the parent as a party defendant.
(B) If the petitioner has named and served a putative

putative parent has established significant contacts with the juvenile, the
court shall:
(i) Enter an order stating that the rights of the
putative parent have attached; and
(ii) Maintain the putative parent as a party
defendant.
(3) If the circuit court finds that the putative parent, after
being given notice and opportunity to be heard, has not established paternity
or significant contacts with the juvenile, the circuit court shall:
(A) Find that the:
(i) Putative parent is not a parent for the purposes
of this subchapter; and
(ii) Rights of the putative parent have not attached;
and
(B) Dismiss the putative parent from the case and enter an
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 107 of 237

order finding that no further notice, including without limitation notice of

parent if:
(A) The court determines that the health and safety of the
juvenile can be adequately protected; and
(B) It is in the best interest of the child.
(2) Unless the court has restricted unsupervised family time,
the Department of Human Services may allow unsupervised family time between a
juvenile and a parent at any time.
(b)(1) The petitioner has the burden of proving at every hearing that
unsupervised family time is not in the best interest of a child.
(2) If the court determines that unsupervised family time
between a juvenile and a parent is not in the best interest of the child,
family time between the juvenile and the parent shall be supervised.
(c)(1) A rebuttable presumption that unsupervised family time is in
the best interest of the juvenile applies at every hearing.
(2) The burden of proof to rebut the presumption in subdivision
(c)(1) of this section is proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
(d) The court may consider the preferences of the juvenile regarding
family time if the juvenile is of a sufficient age and capacity to reason,
regardless of the juvenile's chronological age.
(e)(1) If the court orders supervised family time, the parent from
whom custody of the juvenile has been removed shall receive a minimum of four
(4) hours of supervised family time per week.
(2) The court may order less than four (4) hours of supervised
family time if the court determines that the supervised family time:
(A) Is not in the best interest of the juvenile; or
(B) Will impose an extreme hardship on one (1) of the
parties.
(f)(1) A parent testing positive for a drug on a drug test is an
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 108 of 237

insufficient reason to deny the parent family time with the juvenile if the
court has ordered family time between the parent and a juvenile.
(2) Family time that was ordered by the court may be canceled
if, at the time that family time between the parent and a juvenile occurs,
the parent:
(A) Is under the influence of drugs or alcohol;

(A) Background check; and
(B) Child maltreatment registry check; and
(3) The relative or fictive kin meets the driving requirements
established by the department.
9-35-316. Adjudication hearing.
(a)(1)(A) An adjudication hearing shall be held to determine whether
the allegations in a petition are substantiated by the proof.
(B)(i) If the court finds that the juvenile is dependent-
neglected, the court shall determine whether a noncustodial parent
contributed to the dependency-neglect and whether the noncustodial parent is
a fit parent for purposes of custody or family time.
(ii) A noncustodial parent in subdivision
(a)(1)(B)(i) of this section is presumed to be a fit parent.
(iii)(a) If no earlier court order has been entered
into evidence concerning custody or family time with the noncustodial parent
of the juvenile subject to the dependency-neglect petition, the petitioner
shall, and any party may, provide evidence to the court whether the
noncustodial parent is unfit for purposes of custody or family time.
(b) The petitioner shall provide evidence as
to whether the noncustodial parent contributed to the dependency-neglect.
(iv)(a) The court may transfer temporary custody or
permanent custody to the noncustodial parent after a review of evidence and a
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 109 of 237

finding that it is in the best interest of the juvenile to transfer custody,
or the court may order family time with the noncustodial parent.
(b) An order of transfer of custody to the
noncustodial parent does not relieve the Department of Human Services of the
responsibility to provide services to the parent from whom custody was
removed, unless the court enters an order to relieve the department of the
responsibility.
(c) A home study is not required to transfer
custody to a parent of the juvenile.
(v) If the court determines that the child cannot
safely be placed in the custody of the noncustodial parent, the court shall
make specific findings of fact regarding the safety factors that need to be
corrected by the noncustodial parent before placement or family time with the
juvenile.
(2) Unless the court finds that a removal occurred due to an
emergency and the agency had no prior contact with the family or the child,
evidence shall be presented to the court regarding all prior contact between
the agency and the juvenile or the family before a finding of reasonable
efforts to prevent removal by the department.
(3) A finding of reasonable efforts to prevent removal of the
juvenile is void if the court determines that the department failed to
disclose all prior contact between the agency and juvenile or the family
before the finding.
(4)(A) The dependency-neglect adjudication hearing shall be held
within thirty (30) days after the probable cause hearing under § 9-35-310.

continue the adjudication hearing up to sixty (60) days after the removal
for good cause shown.

has been filed to remove the juvenile from the custody of a parent, a
subsequent adjudication is required if the ground for the removal is not the
same as the ground previously adjudicated.
(b)(1) Following an adjudication in which a juvenile is found to be
dependent-neglected, the court may order any studies, evaluations, or
predisposition reports, if needed, that bear on disposition.
(2)(A) All reports under subdivision (b)(1) of this section
shall be provided in writing to all parties and counsel at least two (2) days
before the disposition hearing.
(B) All parties shall be given a fair opportunity to
controvert any parts of reports under subdivision (b)(1) of this section.

(a)(1) A juvenile who is alleged to be or who has been adjudicated
either dependent-neglected or a member of a family in need of services shall
not be placed or detained in a secure detention facility, in a facility
utilized for the detention of alleged or adjudicated delinquent juveniles, or
in a facility utilized for the detention of adults held for, charged with, or
convicted of a crime except that a juvenile may be held in a juvenile

lives out of state.
9-35-318. Removal of juvenile.

or family in need of services juvenile removed from the custody of his or her
parent, guardian, or custodian and placed with the Department of Human
Services or other licensed agency responsible for the care of juveniles or
with a relative or other individual, the court shall order family services
appropriate to prevent removal unless the health and safety of the juvenile
warrant immediate removal for the protection of the juvenile.
(b) When the court orders a dependent-neglected juvenile removed from
the custody of a parent, guardian, or custodian and placed in the custody of
the department or other licensed agency responsible for the care of juveniles
or with a relative or other individual, the court shall make these specific
findings in the order:
(1) In the initial order of removal, the court must find

juvenile were reasonable, based upon the needs of the family and the
juvenile.
(c) When the state agency's first contact with the family has occurred
during an emergency in which the juvenile could not safely remain at home,

shall be deemed to have made reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the
need for removal.
(d) When the court finds that the department's preventive or
reunification efforts have not been reasonable, but further preventive or
reunification efforts could not permit the juvenile to remain safely at home,
the court may authorize or continue the removal of the juvenile but shall
note the failure by the department in the record of the case.

regarding the educational issues of the child and whether the parent or
guardian of the child may:

(A) Have access to the child's school records;

child, including the name and address of the child's foster parent or
provider, if the parent or guardian has access to the child's school records;
and

activities at the child's school.
(2) If the court transfers custody of a child to the department,
the court may appoint an individual to consent to an initial evaluation of

department, the juvenile shall be placed in a licensed or approved foster
home, shelter, or facility, or an exempt child welfare agency as defined
under § 9-28-402.

(B) The juvenile's health and safety shall be the
paramount concern of the court in determining if the department could have
made reasonable efforts to prevent the juvenile's removal.
(2) If the court finds that reasonable efforts to deliver family
services could have been made with the juvenile safely remaining at home but
were not made, the court may:
(A) Dismiss the petition;

(B) This section shall not be used to terminate the rights
of a putative parent if a court of competent jurisdiction has previously
determined under § 9-35-314 that the rights of the putative parent have not

(3) The intent of this section is to provide permanency in a
juvenile's life in all instances in which the return of a juvenile to the

accomplished in a reasonable period of time as viewed from the juvenile's
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 127 of 237

perspective.
(4) The court shall rely upon the record of the parent's

if the termination petition is granted; and
(ii) The potential harm, specifically addressing the
effect on the health and safety of the child, caused by returning the child
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 128 of 237

to the custody of the parent, parents, or putative parent or parents; and
(B) Of one (1) or more of the following grounds:
(i)(a) That a juvenile has been adjudicated by the
court to be dependent-neglected and has continued to be out of the:

(12) months and, despite a meaningful effort by the department to
rehabilitate the parent and correct the conditions that caused removal, those
conditions have not been remedied by the parent; or
(2) Home of the noncustodial parent for
twelve (12) months and, despite a meaningful effort by the department to
rehabilitate the parent and correct the conditions that prevented the child
from safely being placed in the parent's home, the conditions have not been
remedied by the parent.

period referenced in subdivision (b)(3)(B)(i)(a)(1) of this section
immediately precede the filing of the petition for termination of parental
rights or that it be for twelve (12) consecutive months;
(ii)(a) The juvenile has lived outside the
home of the parent for a period of twelve (12) months, and the parent has
willfully failed to provide significant material support in accordance with
the parent's means or to maintain meaningful contact with the juvenile.
(b) To find willful failure to maintain
meaningful contact, it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from
visiting or having contact with the juvenile by the juvenile's custodian or
any other person, taking into consideration the distance of the juvenile's
placement from the parent's home.
(c) Material support consists of either
financial contributions or food, shelter, clothing, or other necessities when
the contribution has been requested by the juvenile's custodian or ordered by
a court of competent jurisdiction.

period under subdivision (b)(3)(B)(ii)(a) of this section immediately precede
the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights or that it be
for twelve (12) consecutive months;
(iii)(a) The parent is not the biological
parent of the juvenile and the welfare of the juvenile can best be served by
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 129 of 237

terminating the parental rights of the parent.

endanger the life of the child, sexual abuse, or sexual exploitation, any of

stepparents.
(b) Such findings by the juvenile division of
circuit court shall constitute grounds for immediate termination of the
parental rights of one (1) or both of the parents;
(vii)(a) That other factors or issues arose
subsequent to the filing of the original petition for dependency-neglect that
demonstrate that placement of the juvenile in the custody of the parent is
contrary to the juvenile's health, safety, or welfare and that, despite the
offer of appropriate family services, the parent has manifested the
incapacity or indifference to remedy the subsequent issues or factors or
rehabilitate the parent's circumstances that prevent the placement of the
juvenile in the custody of the parent.
(b) The department shall make reasonable
accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., as it existed on January 1, 2025, to parents

established.
(a) Absent orders of a circuit court or another court of competent

or herself, or the Office of Child Support Enforcement may bring an action to
establish paternity or support of a juvenile for whom paternity has not been

court, the court may hear evidence and issue temporary orders and findings

one, the court shall render judgment for the amount paid under the temporary
order against the petitioner if such was the biological mother.

(2) The court may award custody to a father who has had
paternity established if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence

juvenile by providing care, supervision, protection, and financial support
for the juvenile; and
(C) It is in the best interest of the juvenile to award
custody to the father.
(f) At the request of either party in a paternity action, the trial
court shall direct that the putative father, biological mother, and juvenile
submit to one (1) or more blood tests or other scientific examinations or
tests, including deoxyribonucleic acid typing, to:
(1) Determine whether or not the putative father can be excluded
as being the father of the juvenile; and
(2) Establish the probability of paternity if the test does not
exclude the putative father.

duly qualified physician or physicians, or by another duly qualified person
or persons, not to exceed three (3), to be appointed by the court.

shall be receivable in evidence.

certified by an affidavit duly subscribed and sworn to by the expert before a
notary public, may be introduced in evidence in illegitimacy actions without
calling the expert as a witness.
(ii) If either party shall desire to question the
expert, the party shall have the expert subpoenaed within a reasonable time
before trial.
(B) If the results of the paternity tests establish a
ninety-five percent (95%) or more probability of inclusion that the putative
father is the biological father of the juvenile and after corroborating
testimony of the mother in regard to access during the probable period of
conception, this shall constitute a prima facie case of establishment of
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 136 of 237

paternity and the burden of proof shall shift to the putative father to rebut
such proof.
(3) The experts shall be subject to cross-examination by both
parties after the court has caused them to disclose their findings.
(i) Whenever the court orders the blood tests to be taken and one (1)
of the parties refuses to submit to the test, that fact shall be disclosed
upon the trial unless good cause is shown to the contrary.
(j) The costs of the test and witness fees shall be taxed by the court
as other costs in the case.
(k) Whenever it shall be relevant to the prosecution or the defense in
a paternity action, blood tests that exclude third parties as the father of
the juvenile shall be the same as set out in subsections (f) and (g) of this
section.
(l) The refusal of a party to submit to a genetic or other ordered
test is admissible at a hearing to determine paternity only as to the
credibility of the party.
(m) If a male witness offers testimony indicating that his act of
intercourse with the mother may have resulted in the conception of the
juvenile, the court may require the witness to submit to genetic or other
tests to determine whether he is the juvenile's father.

court shall direct that the putative father, biological mother, and juvenile
submit to one (1) or more blood tests or other scientific examinations or
tests, including deoxyribonucleic acid typing, to:
(1) Determine whether or not the putative father can be excluded
as being the father of the juvenile; and

calling the expert as a witness.

expert, the party shall have the expert subpoenaed within a reasonable time
before trial.
(B) If the results of the paternity tests establish a
ninety-five percent (95%) or more probability of inclusion that the putative
father is the biological father of the juvenile and after corroborating
testimony of the mother in regard to access during the probable period of
conception, this shall constitute a prima facie case of establishment of
paternity and the burden of proof shall shift to the putative father to rebut
the proof.
(3) The experts shall be subject to cross-examination by both
parties after the court has caused them to disclose their findings.
(i) When the court orders the blood tests to be taken and one (1) of

section.

test is admissible at a hearing to determine paternity only as to the
credibility of the party.

was not attributable to a purposeful refusal to obey the sentence of the
court or was not due to a failure on his or her part to make a good faith
effort to obtain the funds required for payment.
(2) In determining whether to revoke probation, the court shall
consider the juvenile's employment status, earning ability, financial

pay.

fine, costs, or restitution is excusable under subdivision (f)(1) of this

the Arkansas Code amended by this act in connection with the recodification

Ninety-Fifth General Assembly amending the Arkansas Juvenile Code of 1989 or
to provisions of the Arkansas Code amended by this act in connection with the
recodification of the Arkansas Juvenile Code into the appropriate provisions
of the Arkansas Code so long as those revisions do not result in a change in
the substance or meaning of a provision of the act; and
(2) Make technical changes to the Arkansas Code necessary to
implement this act, including without limitation changes to citations in the
Arkansas Code referencing provisions of Arkansas law amended by this act.
SECTION 68. DO NOT CODIFY. Technical revisions to Code of Arkansas
Rules.
(a) The General Assembly finds that, as a result of the recodification
of the Arkansas Juvenile Code and other amendments to the Arkansas Code under
this act, multiple statutory references to the Arkansas Juvenile Code or
other provisions of Arkansas law in the Code of Arkansas Rules will be
incorrect and require revision to reflect the changes implemented by this
act.
(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that these provisions of
the Code of Arkansas Rules be updated by the Bureau of Legislative Research
as part of its maintenance of the Code of Arkansas Rules.
(c) The bureau shall update statutory references to the Arkansas

implementation of recodification of the Arkansas Juvenile Code.
(a)(1) The General Assembly finds that:
(A) The implementation of this act involves a multitude of
changes to existing Arkansas law;

technical and require careful study of the purpose and context of each
Arkansas Code section, with the need for some of the changes not becoming
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 235 of 237

apparent until after the implementation of this act;
(C) When implementing revisions as large and comprehensive
as the changes under this act, it is inevitable that certain sections of the
Arkansas Code requiring technical changes to follow the intent of this act
will be either omitted or amended in a manner that is later found to be
erroneous and unintentional;
(D) It is likewise inevitable that other acts enacted by
the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly will not take into account the changes in
this act, resulting in technical inconsistencies between newly passed laws;
and
(E) If the correct statutory change to remedy an
unintentional error or an inconsistency between this act and another act of
the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly is readily apparent and consistent with the
intent of this act, the unintentional error or inconsistency should be
corrected as part of the codification process due to the technical nature of
the unintentional error or inconsistency.
(2) It is the intent of the General Assembly to empower the
Arkansas Code Revision Commission to correct technical errors identified in
the Arkansas Code during the implementation of this act to allow this act to
be fully implemented.
(b)(1)(A) Any person or state entity identifying one (1) or more
sections of the Arkansas Code that require revision to implement the intent
of this act may notify the Director of the Bureau of Legislative Research or
his or her designee of the section or sections at issue.
(B) If the Bureau of Legislative Research, while assisting
the commission with the commission's powers and duties, becomes aware of one
(1) or more sections of the Arkansas Code that require revision to implement
the intent of this act for which it appears that the bureau and the
commission do not have authority to make the necessary revision under § 1-2-
303(d), the bureau may notify the commission of the section or sections at
issue.
(2) If the commission determines that the revision necessary to
one (1) or more sections of the Arkansas Code under subdivision (b)(1) of
this section is technical in nature, germane to the intent of this act, and
consistent with this act's policy and purposes, the commission may make the
revision to the Arkansas Code.
LJH215 - 03-18-2025 02:17:29 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 320 Page 236 of 237

(3) The commission shall notify the publisher of the Arkansas
Code of a revision to the Arkansas Code under subdivision (b)(2) of this
section as soon as possible so that the revision may be reflected in the
official hard copy version of the Arkansas Code and the official electronic
version of the Arkansas Code.
(4)(A) Except as provided in subdivision (b)(4)(B) of this
section, when the commission approves a revision to the Arkansas Code under
subdivision (b)(2) of this section, the commission shall notify the following
of the revision within thirty (30) days:
(i) The Speaker of the House of Representatives;
(ii) The President Pro Tempore of the Senate; and
(iii) The Legislative Council.
(B) The commission is not required to make a notification
under subdivision (b)(4)(A) of this section if the revision is made under §
