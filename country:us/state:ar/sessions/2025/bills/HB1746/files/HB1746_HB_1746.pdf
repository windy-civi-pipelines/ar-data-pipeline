17 SECTION 5. Arkansas Code § 4-2-102 is amended to read as follows:
18 4-2-102. Scope — Certain security and other transactions excluded from
19 chapter.
20 (1) Unless the context otherwise requires, and except as provided in
21 subsection (3), this chapter applies to transactions in goods and, in the
22 case of a hybrid transaction, it applies to the extent provided in subsection
23 (2); it does not apply to any transaction which although in the form of an

26 regulating sales to consumers, farmers or other specified classes of buyers.
27 (2) In a hybrid transaction:
28 (a) If the sale-of-goods aspects do not predominate, only the
29 provisions of this chapter which relate primarily to the sale-of-goods
30 aspects of the transaction apply, and the provisions that relate primarily to

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 (a) apply to a transaction that, even though in the form of an

10 “Cancellation” — "Hybrid Transaction".
11 (1) In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires “contract”
12 and “agreement” are limited to those relating to the present or future sale
13 of goods. “Contract for sale” includes both a present sale of goods and a
14 contract to sell goods at a future time. A “sale” consists in the passing of
15 title from the seller to the buyer for a price (§ 4-2-401). A “present sale”
16 means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.
17 (2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are
18 “conforming” or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the
19 obligations under the contract.
20 (3) “Termination” occurs when either party pursuant to a power created
21 by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its
22 breach. On “termination” all obligations which are still executory on both
23 sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance
24 survives.
25 (4) “Cancellation” occurs when either party puts an end to the
26 contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of
27 “termination” except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for
28 breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.
29 (5) “Hybrid transaction” means a single transaction involving a sale of
30 goods and:
31 (a) the provision of services;
32 (b) a lease of other goods; or
33 (c) a sale, lease, or license of property other than goods.
34
35 SECTION 7. Arkansas Code § 4-2-201 is amended to read as follows:
36 4-2-201. Formal requirements — Statute of frauds.
9 04-09-2025 15:36:43 ANS152

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section a contract for the
2 sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars ($500) or more is not
3 enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing a record
4 sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the
5 parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his
6 the party's authorized agent or broker. A writing record is not insufficient
7 because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is
8 not enforceable under this paragraph subsection beyond the quantity of goods
9 shown in such writing the record.
10 (2) Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing record in
11 confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received
12 and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the
13 requirements of subsection (1) against such the party unless written notice
14 in a record of objection to its contents is given within ten (10) days after
15 it is received.
16 (3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection
17 (1) but which is valid in other respects is enforceable:
18 (a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer
19 and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the
20 seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received
21 and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the
22 buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or
23 commitments for their procurement; or
24 (b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in
25 his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was
26 made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the
27 quantity of goods admitted; or
28 (c) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and
29 accepted or which have been received and accepted (§ 4-2-606).
30
31 SECTION 8. Arkansas Code § 4-2-202 is amended to read as follows:
32 4-2-202. Final written expression — Parol or extrinsic evidence.
33 Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties
34 agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing record intended by the
35 parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms
36 as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior
10 04-09-2025 15:36:43 ANS152

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or
2 supplemented:
3 (a) by course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of
4 trade (§ 4-1-303); and

6 finds the writing record to have been intended also as a complete and
7 exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.
8
9 SECTION 9. Arkansas Code § 4-2-203 is amended to read as follows:
10 4-2-203. Seals inoperative.

12 sale or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing record
13 a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not
14 apply to such a contract or offer.
15
16 SECTION 10. Arkansas Code § 4-2-205 is amended to read as follows:
17 4-2-205. Firm offers.
18 An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing record
19 which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not
20 revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is
21 stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of
22 irrevocability exceed three (3) months; but any such term of assurance on a
23 form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.
24
25 SECTION 11. Arkansas Code § 4-2-209(2), concerning the modification or
26 rescission of a signed writing under the Uniform Commercial Code, is amended
27 to read as follows:
28 (2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission
29 except by a signed writing or other signed record cannot be otherwise
30 modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on
31 a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.
32
33 SECTION 12. Arkansas Code § 4-2A-102 is amended to read as follows:
34 4-2A-102. Scope.
35 (1) This chapter applies to any transaction, regardless of form, that

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 provided in subsection (2).
2 (2) In a hybrid lease:
3 (a) if the lease-of-goods aspects do not predominate:
4 (i) only the provisions of this chapter which relate
5 primarily to the lease-of-goods aspects of the transaction apply, and the
6 provisions that relate primarily to the transaction as a whole do not apply;
7 (ii) Section 4-2A-209 applies if the lease is a finance
8 lease; and
9 (iii) Section 4-2A-407 applies to the promises of the
10 lessee in a finance lease to the extent the promises are consideration for
11 the right to possession and use of the leased goods; and
12 (b) if the lease-of-goods aspects predominate, this chapter
13 applies to the transaction, but does not preclude application in appropriate
14 circumstances of other law to aspects of the lease which do not relate to the
15 lease of goods.
16
17 SECTION 13. Arkansas Code § 4-2A-103(1), concerning definitions used

28 (b) there is a writing record, signed by the party against whom

30 indicate that a lease contract has been made between the parties and to

33 and satisfies subsection (1)(b), whether or not it is specific, if it

9 the goods are for the lessee, has made either a substantial beginning of
10 their manufacture or commitments for their procurement;
11 (b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746

9 of the check in connection with a process in which information is extracted
10 from the check and an image of the check is made and, subsequently, the
11 information and image are transmitted for payment.
12 (b) Cancellation or striking out of an indorsement pursuant to

20 SECTION 24. Arkansas Code § 4-4A-103(a)(1), concerning the definition
21 of "payment order" used in the Uniform Commercial Code, is amended to read as
22 follows:
23 (1) “Payment order” means an instruction of a sender to a
24 receiving bank, transmitted orally, electronically, or in writing or in a
25 record, to pay, or to cause another bank to pay, a fixed or determinable
26 amount of money to a beneficiary if:
27 (i) the instruction does not state a condition to payment
28 to the beneficiary other than time of payment,
29 (ii) the receiving bank is to be reimbursed by debiting an
30 account of, or otherwise receiving payment from, the sender, and
31 (iii) the instruction is transmitted by the sender
32 directly to the receiving bank or to an agent, funds-transfer system, or

20 04-09-2025 15:36:43 ANS152

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 “Security procedure” means a procedure established by agreement of a
2 customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of (i) verifying that a payment
3 order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the
4 customer, or (ii) detecting error in the transmission or the content of the
5 payment order or communication. A security procedure may impose an obligation
6 on the receiving bank or the customer and may require the use of algorithms
7 or other codes, identifying words, or numbers, symbols, sounds, biometrics,
8 encryption, callback procedures, or similar security devices. Comparison of a
9 signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen
10 signature of the customer or requiring a payment order to be sent from a
11 known email address, IP address, or telephone number is not by itself a
12 security procedure.
13
14 SECTION 26. Arkansas Code § 4-4A-202(b), concerning the verification
15 and authenticity of payment orders under the Uniform Commercial Code, is
16 amended to read as follows:
17 (b) If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of
18 payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will
19 be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the
20 receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not
21 authorized, if (i) the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method
22 of providing security against unauthorized payment orders, and (ii) the bank
23 proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance
24 with the bank's obligations under the security procedure and any written
25 agreement or instruction of the customer, evidenced by a record, restricting
26 acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is
27 not required to follow an instruction that violates a written an agreement
28 with the customer, evidenced by a record, or notice of which is not received
29 at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act
30 on it before the payment order is accepted.
31
32 SECTION 27. Arkansas Code § 4-4A-202(c), concerning the commercial
33 reasonableness of the security procedure used to verify the authenticity of a
34 payment order under the Uniform Commercial Code, is amended to read as
35 follows:
36 (c) Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of
21 04-09-2025 15:36:43 ANS152

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to
2 the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the
3 size, type, and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer
4 to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer, and
5 security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly
6 situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if (i)
7 the security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and
8 the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable
9 for that customer, and (ii) the customer expressly agreed in writing a record
10 to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its
11 name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the bank's obligations under
12 the security procedure chosen by the customer.
13
14 SECTION 28. Arkansas Code § 4-4A-203(a)(1), concerning the
15 unenforceability of certain payment orders under the Uniform Commercial Code,
16 is amended to read as follows:
17 (1) By express written agreement evidenced by a record, the
18 receiving bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or
19 retain payment of the payment order.
20
21 SECTION 29. Arkansas Code § 4-4A-207(c)(2), concerning the rules
22 applicable for misdescription of a beneficiary of a payment order under the
23 Uniform Commercial Code, is amended to read as follows:
24 (2) If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person
25 identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator,
26 the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank
27 proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had
28 notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made
29 by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account
30 number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary.
31 Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank
32 satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the
33 payment order was accepted, signed a writing record stating the information
34 to which the notice relates.
35
36 SECTION 30. Arkansas Code § 4-4A-208(b)(2), concerning the
22 04-09-2025 15:36:43 ANS152

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 misdescription of an intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank in a payment
2 order under the Uniform Commercial Code, is amended to read as follows:
3 (2) If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves
4 that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the
5 receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the
6 intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different
7 from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender
8 and the receiving bank are governed by subsection (b)(1), as though the
9 sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence.
10 The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the
11 sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing record
12 stating the information to which the notice relates.
13
14 SECTION 31. Arkansas Code § 4-4A-210(a), concerning the rejection of a
15 payment order under the Uniform Commercial Code, is amended to read as
16 follows:
17 (a) A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of
18 rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically, or in writing a
19 record. A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is
20 sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or
21 will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is
22 given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances.
23 If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection
24 is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and
25 receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order,
26 (i) any means complying with the agreement is reasonable and (ii) any means
27 not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the
28 notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.
29
30 SECTION 32. Arkansas Code § 4-4A-211(a), concerning the cancellation
31 and amendment of a payment order under the Uniform Commercial Code, is
32 amended to read as follows:
33 (a) A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or
34 amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally,
35 electronically, or in writing a record. If a security procedure is in effect
36 between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective

1 to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to
2 the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.
3
4 SECTION 33. Arkansas Code § 4-4A-305(c) and (d), concerning the
5 liability of consequential damages for late or improper execution or failure
6 to execute a payment order under the Uniform Commercial Code, are amended to
7 read as follows:
8 (c) In addition to the amounts payable under subsections (a) and (b),
9 damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent
10 provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank, evidenced by
11 a record.
12 (d) If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was
13 obliged by express agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to the
14 sender for its expenses in the transaction and for incidental expenses and
15 interest losses resulting from the failure to execute. Additional damages,
16 including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an
17 express written agreement of the receiving bank, evidenced by a record, but
18 are not otherwise recoverable.

24 authenticated (i) by a signature or (ii) in accordance with the agreement of
25 the parties or the standard practice referred to in § 4-5-108(e).
26
27 SECTION 35. Arkansas Code § 4-5-116 is amended to read as follows:
28 4-5-116. Choice of law and forum.

30 action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction chosen by an
31 agreement in the form of a record signed or otherwise authenticated by the
32 affected parties in the manner provided in § 4-5-104 or by a provision in the
33 person's letter of credit, confirmation, or other undertaking. The
34 jurisdiction whose law is chosen need not bear any relation to the
35 transaction.
36 (b) Unless subsection (a) of this section applies, the liability of an
24 04-09-2025 15:36:43 ANS152

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 issuer, nominated person, or adviser for action or omission is governed by
2 the law of the jurisdiction in which the person is located. The person is
3 considered to be located at the address indicated in the person's
4 undertaking. If more than one (1) address is indicated, the person is
5 considered to be located at the address from which the person's undertaking
6 was issued.
7 (c) For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law, and recognition of

15 4-12-107. Governing Law.
16 (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the local law of a
17 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction governs a matter covered by
18 this chapter.
19 (b) For a controllable electronic record that evidences a controllable
20 account or controllable payment intangible, the local law of the controllable
21 electronic record’s jurisdiction governs a matter covered by § 4-12-106
22 unless an effective agreement determines that the local law of another
23 jurisdiction governs.
24 (c) The following rules determine a controllable electronic record’s
25 jurisdiction under this section:
26 (1) If the controllable electronic record, or a record attached
27 to or logically associated with the controllable electronic record and
28 readily available for review, expressly provides that a particular
29 jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction for
30 purposes of this chapter or the Uniform Commercial Code, that jurisdiction is
31 the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction.
32 (2) If paragraph (1) does not apply and the rules of the system
33 in which the controllable electronic record is recorded are readily available
34 for review and expressly provide that a particular jurisdiction is the
35 controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction for purposes of this chapter or
36 the Uniform Commercial Code, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic
98 04-09-2025 15:36:43 ANS152

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 record’s jurisdiction.
2 (3) If paragraphs (1) and (2) do not apply and the controllable
3 electronic record, or a record attached to or logically associated with the
4 controllable electronic record and readily available for review, expressly
5 provides that the controllable electronic record is governed by the law of a
6 particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic
7 record’s jurisdiction.
8 (4) If paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) do not apply and the rules
9 of the system in which the controllable electronic record is recorded are
10 readily available for review and expressly provide that the controllable
11 electronic record or the system is governed by the law of a particular
12 jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the controllable electronic record’s
13 jurisdiction.
14 (5) If paragraphs (1) through (4) do not apply, the controllable
15 electronic record’s jurisdiction is the District of Columbia.
16 (d) If subsection (c)(5) applies and Chapter 12 is not in effect in
17 the District of Columbia without material modification, the governing law for
18 a matter covered by this chapter is the law of the District of Columbia as
19 though Chapter 12 were in effect in the District of Columbia without material
20 modification. In this subsection, “Chapter 12” means Chapter 12 of Uniform
21 Commercial Code Amendments (2022).
22 (e) To the extent subsections (a) and (b) provide that the local law
23 of the controllable electronic record’s jurisdiction governs a matter covered
24 by this chapter, that law governs even if the matter or a transaction to
25 which the matter relates does not bear any relation to the controllable
26 electronic record’s jurisdiction.
27 (f) The rights acquired under § 4-12-104 by a purchaser or qualifying
28 purchaser are governed by the law applicable under this section at the time
29 of purchase.

3 (1) a transaction, lien, or interest in property that was
4 validly entered into, created, or transferred before September 1, 2026 and
5 was not governed by the Uniform Commercial Code, but would be subject to
6 Chapter 9 as amended by this act or Chapter 12 if it had been entered into,

12 by the law that would apply if this act had not taken effect.
13 (c) This act does not affect an action, case, or proceeding commenced
14 before September 1, 2026.
15
16 4-12A-302. Security interest perfected before effective date.
17 (a) A security interest that is enforceable and perfected immediately
18 before September 1, 2026 is a perfected security interest under this act if,
19 on September 1, 2026, the requirements for enforceability and perfection
20 under this act are satisfied without further action.
21 (b) If a security interest is enforceable and perfected immediately
22 before September 1, 2026, but the requirements for enforceability or
23 perfection under this act are not satisfied on September 1, 2026, the
24 security interest:
25 (1) is a perfected security interest until the earlier of the
26 time perfection would have ceased under the law in effect immediately before
27 September 1, 2026 or the adjustment date;
28 (2) remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest
29 satisfies the requirements for enforceability under § 4-9-203, as amended by
30 this act, before the adjustment date; and
31 (3) remains perfected thereafter only if the requirements for
32 perfection under this act are satisfied before the time specified in
33 paragraph (1).
34
35 4-12A-303. Security interest unperfected before effective date.
36 A security interest that is enforceable immediately before September 1,
101 04-09-2025 15:36:43 ANS152

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 2026, but is unperfected at that time:
2 (1) remains an enforceable security interest until the
3 adjustment date;
4 (2) remains enforceable thereafter if the security interest
5 becomes enforceable under § 4-9-203, as amended by this act, on September 1,
6 2026, or before the adjustment date; and
7 (3) becomes perfected:
8 (A) without further action, on September 1, 2026, if the
9 requirements for perfection under this act are satisfied before or at that
10 time; or
11 (B) when the requirements for perfection are satisfied if
12 the requirements are satisfied after that time.
13
14 4-12A-304. Effectiveness of actions taken before effective date.
15 (a) If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is
16 taken before September 1, 2026, and the action would have resulted in
17 perfection of the security interest had the security interest become
18 enforceable before September 1, 2026, the action is effective to perfect a
19 security interest that attaches under this act before the adjustment date. An
20 attached security interest becomes unperfected on the adjustment date unless
21 the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under this act
22 before the adjustment date.
23 (b) The filing of a financing statement before September 1, 2026, is
24 effective to perfect a security interest on September 1, 2026, to the extent
25 the filing would satisfy the requirements for perfection under this act.
26 (c) The taking of an action before September 1, 2026, is sufficient
27 for the enforceability of a security interest on September 1, 2026, if the
28 action would satisfy the requirements for enforceability under this act.
29
30 4-12A-305. Priority.
31 (a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c), this act determines the
32 priority of conflicting claims to collateral.
33 (b) Subject to subsection (c), if the priorities of claims to
34 collateral were established before September 1, 2026, Chapter 9 as in effect
35 before September 1, 2026, determines priority.
36 (c) On the adjustment date, to the extent the priorities determined by
102 04-09-2025 15:36:43 ANS152

As Engrossed: S4/9/25 HB1746
1 Chapter 9 as amended by this act modify the priorities established before
2 September 1, 2026, the priorities of claims to Chapter 12 property and
3 electronic money established before September 1, 2026, cease to apply.
4
5 4-12A-306. Priority of claims when priority rules of Chapter 9 do
6 not apply.
7 (a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c), Chapter 12 determines the
8 priority of conflicting claims to Chapter 12 property when the priority rules
9 of Chapter 9 as amended by this act do not apply.
10 (b) Subject to subsection (c), when the priority rules of Chapter 9 as
11 amended by this act do not apply and the priorities of claims to Chapter 12
12 property were established before September 1, 2026, law other than Chapter 12
13 determines priority.
14 (c) When the priority rules of Chapter 9 as amended by this act do not
15 apply, to the extent the priorities determined by this act modify the
16 priorities established before September 1, 2026, the priorities of claims to
