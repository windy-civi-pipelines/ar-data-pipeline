30 contain an unplugged brine production or brine disposal well;
31 (ii) There have been no brine production wells or
32 brine disposal wells located within one-half (1/2 mi.) mile of any exterior

3 (4)(A) The operator or operators of two (2) adjacent brine
4 production units or brine expansion units may apply to the commission to
5 transfer one (1) or more contiguous tracts from the unit to the adjacent

12 (ii) Operation of the brine production unit
13 receiving the transferred tract or tracts will be expanded, enhanced, or made
14 more efficient by the proposed transfer;
15 (iii) Transfer will drain efficiently the area
16 within the tract or tracts so transferred; and
17 (iv) Transfer will have no adverse impact on either
18 the amount or the reasonably anticipated longevity of the royalty payments
19 due to the owners of the tract or tracts so transferred and will not
20 otherwise substantially impair the correlative rights of the owners of the
21 tract or tracts transferred or of owners within the brine unit receiving the
22 transferred tract.
23 (5) Upon the commission’s approval of the transfer, the
24 transferred tract or tracts shall become a brine expansion unit adjacent to
