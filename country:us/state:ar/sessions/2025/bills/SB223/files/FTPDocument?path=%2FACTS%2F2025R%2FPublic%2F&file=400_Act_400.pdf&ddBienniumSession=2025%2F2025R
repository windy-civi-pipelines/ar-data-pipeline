18
19 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
20 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
21 (1) Religious freedom is a cornerstone of our democracy and is
22 essential to the dignity and freedom of every individual;
23 (2) Arkansas Constitution Article 14, § 1, provides that
24 "Intelligence and virtue being the safeguards of liberty and the bulwark of a
25 free and good government, the State shall ever maintain a general, suitable
26 and efficient system of free public schools and shall adopt all suitable
27 means to secure to the people the advantages and opportunities of
28 education.";
29 (3) An important advantage and essential opportunity of a system
30 of free public schools is for students to develop a virtuous lifestyle guided
31 by deeply held, meaningful values;
32 (4) Religious worldviews hold an important place in overall
33 human thought and philosophy;
34 (5) Religious freedom provides an environment and opportunity
35 for students to be exposed to worldviews that form the basis for civilization
36 and thought;

1 (6) Religious freedom at public schools is a right that is
2 protected by state and federal law; and
3 (7) The United States Supreme Court has held in "Tinker v. Des
4 Moines", that neither students nor teachers “shed their constitutional rights
5 to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate".
6 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to:
7 (1) Inform Arkansas residents regarding religious protections
8 and liberties;
9 (2) Ensure that this act serves only as a guide to clarify
10 religious rights at public schools, rather than as an exhaustive list of
11 religious rights at public schools; and
12 (3) Affirm that students and public school employees retain many
13 unlisted rights by virtue of their God-given freedoms, which extend beyond
14 those rights explicitly enumerated in this act.
15
16 SECTION 2. Arkansas Code Title 6, Chapter 10, Subchapter 1, is amended
17 to add an additional section to read as follows:
18 6-10-140. Religious Rights at Public Schools Act of 2025.
19 (a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the "Religious
20 Rights at Public Schools Act of 2025".

22 and open-enrollment public charter school shall provide each enrolled student
23 and individual employed by the public school district or open-enrollment
24 public charter school with a copy of this act by electronic means or by
25 placement in a handbook, policy manual, or other resource designed to inform
26 students, employees, or parents about policies, procedures, or rights.
27 (c) Under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and
28 United States Supreme Court case law interpreting the First Amendment to the
29 United States Constitution, a student enrolled in a public school district or
30 an open-enrollment public charter school shall retain broad religious
31 freedom, which includes without limitation the right to:
