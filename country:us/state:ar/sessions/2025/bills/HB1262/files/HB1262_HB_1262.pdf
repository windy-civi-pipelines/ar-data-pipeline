26 SECTION 3. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
27 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFER
28 RESTRICTIONS. The appropriations provided in this act shall not be
29 transferred under the provisions of Arkansas Code 19-4-522, but only as
30 provided by this act.
31 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
32 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
33
34 SECTION 4. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
35 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFER
36 PROVISIONS. The state-supported institution of higher education in this act
3 01/27/2025 2:03:21 PM HAR034

HB1262
1 may transfer appropriations between the various line items within each
2 appropriation contained in this appropriation act. Such transfers shall be
3 made only after the approval of the Division of Higher Education and the
4 Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, and the approval of the Legislative
5 Council or Joint Budget Committee.
6 The General Assembly has determined that the institution in this act could
7 be operated more efficiently if some flexibility is given to that institution
8 and that flexibility is being accomplished by providing authority to transfer
9 between items of appropriation made by this act. Since the General Assembly
10 has granted the institution broad powers under the transfer of
11 appropriations, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
12 Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the transfers by requiring
13 prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee in the
14 utilization of the transfer authority. Therefore, the requirement of
15 approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a
16 severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the
17 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a
18 court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
19 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
20 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
21
22 SECTION 5. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
23 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. POSITIONS.
24 (a) Nothing in this act shall be construed as a commitment of the State of
25 Arkansas or any of its agencies or institutions to continue funding any
26 position paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement in the event that
27 Tobacco Settlement funds are not sufficient to finance the position.
28 (b) State funds will not be used to replace Tobacco Settlement funds when
29 such funds expire, unless appropriated by the General Assembly and authorized
30 by the Governor.
31 (c) A disclosure of the language contained in (a) and (b) of this Section
32 shall be made available to all new hire and current positions paid from the
33 proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement by the Tobacco Settlement Commission.
34 (d) Whenever applicable the information contained in (a) and (b) of this
35 Section shall be included in the employee handbook and/or Professional
36 Services Contract paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement.

4 SECTION 6. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
5 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
6 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds authorized by this act
7 shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency and funds made
8 available by law for the support of such appropriations; and the restrictions
9 of the State Purchasing Law, the General Accounting and Budgetary Procedures
10 Law, the Regular Salary Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors,
11 and other fiscal control laws of this State, where applicable, and
12 regulations promulgated by the Department of Finance and Administration, as
13 authorized by law, shall be strictly complied with in disbursement of said
14 funds.
15
16 SECTION 7. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
17 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
18 LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General Assembly that any funds
19 disbursed under the authority of the appropriations contained in this act
20 shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for which this act was
21 adopted, as evidenced by Initiated Act 1 of 2000, the Agency Requests,
22 Executive Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the
23 budget manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration,
24 letters, or summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas
25 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and
26 adoption.
27
28 SECTION 8. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
29 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
30 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
31 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
32 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
33 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
34 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
35 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
36 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
5 01/27/2025 2:03:21 PM HAR034

HB1262
1 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
2 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
