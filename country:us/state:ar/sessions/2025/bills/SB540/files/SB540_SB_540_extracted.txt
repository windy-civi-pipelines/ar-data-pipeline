25 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
26 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
27 (1) A 2025 position statement from the American Academy of
28 Neurology endorsed a three-month seizure-free period for drivers with
29 seizures;
30 (2) Seizures are a common occurrence, affecting between nine
31 percent (9%) and ten percent (10%) of the population over the course of a
32 person's lifetime; and
33 (3) Driving is highly regulated for people with epilepsy,
34 compromising their independence, ability to work, and ability to maintain
35 relationships, despite the fact that epilepsy-related car crashes constitute
36 only two-tenths of one percent (0.2%) of car crashes in the United States

5 majority of other states regarding the operation of a motor vehicle by a
6 person who has previously suffered a seizure.
