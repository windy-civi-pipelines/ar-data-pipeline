1 adoption or another permanent placement;
2 (2) The age, maturity, and preference of the child concerning
3 the reinstatement of parental rights;
4 (3) The parent's fitness and whether the parent has remedied the
5 conditions that existed at the time of the termination of his or her parental
6 rights; and
7 (4) The effect that the reinstatement of parental rights would
8 have on the health, safety, and well-being of the child.
9 (g)(h) A court may deny a petition filed under this section if the
10 court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the parent engaged in
11 conduct that interfered with the child's ability to achieve permanency.
12 (h)(i) An order reinstating the parental rights of the parent who is
13 the subject of a petition filed under this section restores all rights,
14 powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations of the parent as to
15 the child, including without limitation custody, control, and support of the
16 child.
17 (i)(j) If the child is placed with a parent whose parental rights are
18 reinstated under this section, the court shall not close the case until the
19 child has resided with the parent for no less than six (6) months.
20 (j)(k) A written order shall be filed by the court, a party, or the
21 attorney of a party as designated by the court within thirty (30) days of the
22 date of the hearing on the motion to reinstate parental rights or before the
23 next hearing, whichever is sooner.
24 (k)(l) An order reinstating parental rights under this section does
25 not:
26 (1) Vacate or affect the validity of a previous order
27 terminating the parental rights of the parent who is the subject of the
28 petition; and
29 (2) Restore or impact the rights of a parent who is not the
30 subject of a petition filed under this section.
31 (l)(m) This section is retroactive and applies to a child who is under
32 the jurisdiction of a court at the time of a hearing on a petition to
33 terminate parental rights, regardless of the date on which parental rights
34 were terminated by court order.
