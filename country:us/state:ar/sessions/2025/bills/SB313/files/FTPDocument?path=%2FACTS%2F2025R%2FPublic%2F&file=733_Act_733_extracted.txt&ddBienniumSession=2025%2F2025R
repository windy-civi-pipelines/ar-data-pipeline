22 to maintain the fitness to proceed of an incarcerated defendant if the

27 (ii) All less intrusive alternatives have been
28 considered;

30 produce a side effect that may undermine the fairness of the trial; and

25 present a danger to himself or herself or to the person or property of
26 another, the court may release the defendant on conditions the court
27 determines to be proper.

4 regained fitness to proceed, the criminal proceeding shall be resumed.
5 (2) If the defendant has been receiving and responding well to
6 treatment, including medication, the court may make appropriate orders for
7 the continued treatment or administration of medication, or both to maintain
8 the fitness of the defendant throughout the remainder of the proceedings.
9 (3) However, if the court is of the view that so much time has
10 elapsed since the alleged commission of the offense in question that it would
11 be unjust to resume the criminal proceeding, the court may dismiss the charge
12 regardless of whether the defendant has regained fitness to proceed.
13 (4)(A) On either the motion of the court or the state, a hearing
14 shall be held to determine whether the charges against a defendant who lacks
