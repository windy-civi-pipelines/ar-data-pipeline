21 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
22 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
23 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
24 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
25 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
26 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
27 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
28 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
29 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
