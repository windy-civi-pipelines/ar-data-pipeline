18
19 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code Title 20, Chapter 9, is amended to add an
20 additional subchapter to read as follows:
21 Subchapter 16 - Assisted Reproductive Technology Reporting Act
22
23 20-9-1601. Title.
24 This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Assisted
25 Reproductive Technology Reporting Act".
26
27 20-9-1602. Legislative findings.
28 The General Assembly finds that:
29 (1) The federal Fertility Clinic Success Rate and Certification
30 Act of 1992 requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track
31 certain health outcomes and success rates of assisted reproductive
32 technology;
33 (2) However, this law lacks a strong enforcement mechanism and
34 is too limited in scope;
35 (3) Additionally, the law governing assisted reproductive
36 technology in Arkansas does not require fertility clinics to report key data
*JMB056*

As Engrossed: H2/26/25 HB1554
1 points related to assisted reproductive technology, maternal and neonatal
2 health, and the total number of embryos created through this procedure; and
3 (4) Therefore, many prospective parents, lawmakers, researchers,
4 and fertility clinics lack an adequate understanding of how assisted
5 reproductive technology functions in the State of Arkansas and information
6 that is essential for prospective parents as they make important decisions
7 about their childbearing options.

9 20-9-1603. Definitions.
10 As used in this subchapter:

28 (3) "Egg donor" means a person unrelated by marriage to the

30 reproduction, regardless of if the recipient has a diagnosis of infertility;

32 embryos are frozen in an undisturbed environment for the purpose of saving
33 these embryos for future procreative use;
34 (5) "Fertility clinic" means a medical facility that is
35 licensed, registered, or certified under federal laws or regulations or state
36 laws and rules and that is responsible for the collection and preservation of

3 (6) "Healthcare professional" means an individual licensed,
4 registered, or certified under federal laws or regulations or state laws and
5 rules to provide healthcare services;
6 (7) "Human embryo" means a distinct and living organism of the
7 species Homo sapiens conceived either in the human body or produced in an
8 artificial environment other than the human body, from the moment of
9 fertilization, including the single-celled stage, until natural death,
10 including such embryos that are in a state of cryopreservation or are
11 otherwise unused;
12 (8) "Human embryo implantation" means a human embryo has
13 successfully attached to a patient’s uterine wall lining which marks the
14 beginning of pregnancy;
15 (9) "Human reproductive material" means all or any part of a
16 sperm, ovum, or embryo at any stage of development;
17 (10) "Infertility" means a symptom of an underlying disease or
18 condition within a person’s body that makes successfully conceiving and
19 carrying a child to term difficult or impossible, which is diagnosed after:
20 (A) Twelve (12) months of intercourse without the use of a
21 chemical, barrier, or other contraceptive method for women under thirty-five
22 (35) years of age; or
23 (B) Six (6) months of targeted intercourse without the use
24 of a chemical, barrier, or other contraceptive method for women who are
25 thirty-five (35) years of age and older, where conception should otherwise be
26 possible;
27 (11) "Prospective patient" means the patient who may undergo
28 assisted reproductive technology treatments, including the transfer of human
29 embryos for the purpose of initiating pregnancy;
30 (12) "Transfer" means the process by which a healthcare
31 professional places a fresh or frozen embryo within the uterus, fallopian
32 tubes, or other part of a patient’s body for the purpose of initiating a
33 pregnancy; and
34 (13) "Sperm donor" means a person unrelated by marriage to a
35 prospective patient who provides or agrees to provide sperm for the purpose
36 of human reproduction, regardless of whether the prospective patient has a

5 and report key data points, including without limitation:
6 (1) How many embryos each fertility clinic creates in total
7 through assisted reproductive technology cycles;
8 (2) What happens to each of the embryos created and the number
9 of embryos that:
