32 Findings and Declaration of Purpose
33
34 a. The party states find that:
35 1. The health and safety of the public are affected by the
36 degree of compliance with APRN licensure requirements and the effectiveness
*JMB105*
01/14/2025 12:32:59 PM JMB105
HB1134
1 of enforcement activities related to state APRN licensure laws;
2 2. Violations of APRN licensure and other laws regulating the
3 practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;
4 3. The expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced
5 communication and intervention technologies as part of our nation’s health
6 care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among
7 states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation;
8 4. New practice modalities and technology make compliance with
9 individual state APRN licensure laws difficult and complex;
10 5. The current system of duplicative APRN licensure for APRNs
11 practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for healthcare
12 delivery systems, payors, state licensing boards, regulators and APRNs;
13 6. Uniformity of APRN licensure requirements throughout the
14 states promotes public safety and public health benefits as well as providing
15 a mechanism to increase access to care.
16 b. The general purposes of this Compact are to:
17 1. Facilitate the states’ responsibility to protect the public’s
18 health and safety;
19 2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the
20 areas of APRN licensure and regulation, including promotion of uniform
21 licensure requirements;
22 3. Facilitate the exchange of information between party states
23 in the areas of APRN regulation, investigation and adverse actions;
24 4. Promote compliance with the laws governing APRN practice in
25 each jurisdiction;
26 5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN
27 accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the
28 patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual
29 recognition of party state privileges to practice;
30 6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of
31 APRN licenses; and
32 7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by APRNs who
33 meet uniform licensure requirements.

36 d. An APRN multistate license issued by a home state to a resident in
6 01/14/2025 12:32:59 PM JMB105
HB1134
1 that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing the APRN to
2 practice as an APRN in each party state, under a multistate licensure
3 privilege, in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in
4 the home state.
5 e. Nothing in this Compact shall affect the requirements established
6 by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license, except that an
7 individual may apply for a single-state license, instead of a multistate
8 license, even if otherwise qualified for the multistate license. However, the
9 failure of such an individual to affirmatively opt for a single state license
10 may result in the issuance of a multistate license.
11 f. Issuance of an APRN multistate license shall include prescriptive
12 authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs.
13 g. For each state in which an APRN seeks authority to prescribe
14 controlled substances, the APRN shall satisfy all requirements imposed by
15 such state in granting and/or renewing such authority.
16 h. An APRN issued a multistate license is authorized to assume
17 responsibility and accountability for patient care independent of any

19 the home state and in any remote state in which the APRN exercises a
20 multistate licensure privilege.
21 i. All party states shall be authorized, in accordance with state due
22 process laws, to take adverse action against an APRN’s multistate licensure
23 privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation or any
24 other action that affects an APRN’s authorization to practice under a
25 multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a

28 coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the home state
29 of any such actions by remote states.
30 j. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Compact, an APRN
31 practicing in a party state must comply with the state practice laws of the
32 state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. APRN
33 practice is not limited to patient care, but shall include all advanced
34 nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in
35 which the client is located. APRN practice in a party state under a
36 multistate licensure privilege will subject the APRN to the jurisdiction of
7 01/14/2025 12:32:59 PM JMB105
HB1134
1 the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the
2 client is located at the time service is provided.
3 k. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Compact, this
4 Compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for
5 advanced practice registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure
6 privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state shall be
7 recognized by other party states as satisfying any state law requirement for
8 registered nurse licensure as a precondition for authorization to practice as
9 an APRN in that state.
10 l. Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able
11 to apply for a party state’s single- state APRN license as provided under the
12 laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these
13 individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice as
14 an APRN in any other party state.

18 Applications for APRN Licensure in a Party State
19
20 a. Upon application for an APRN multistate license, the licensing
21 board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated
22 licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the
23 holder of a licensed practical/vocational nursing license, a registered
24 nursing license or an advanced practice registered nurse license issued by
25 any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or
26 multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse
27 action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege
28 held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in
29 an alternative program.
30 b. An APRN may hold a multistate APRN license, issued by the home
31 state, in only one party state at a time.
32 c. If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving between two
33 party states, the APRN must apply for APRN licensure in the new home state,
34 and the multistate license issued by the prior home state shall be
35 deactivated in accordance with applicable Commission rules.
36 1. The APRN may apply for licensure in advance of a change in
8 01/14/2025 12:32:59 PM JMB105
HB1134
1 primary state of residence.
2
3 2. A multistate APRN license shall not be issued by the new home
4 state until the APRN provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary
5 state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable
6 requirements to obtain a multistate APRN license from the new home state.
7 d. If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving from a
8 party state to a non-party state, the APRN multistate license issued by the
9 prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the
10 former home state.
11
12 ARTICLE V
13
14 Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards
15
16 a. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing
17 board shall have the authority to:
18 1. Take adverse action against an APRN’s multistate licensure
19 privilege to practice within that party state.
20 i. Only the home state shall have power to take adverse
21 action against an APRN’s license issued by the home state.
22 ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state
23 licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct
24 that occurred outside of the home state as it would if such conduct had
25 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its
26 own state laws to determine appropriate action.
27 2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an
28 APRN’s authority to practice within that party state.
29 3. Complete any pending investigations of an APRN who changes
30 primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The
31 licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s)
32 and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the
33 administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The
34 administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly
35 notify the new home state of any such actions.
36 4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that
9 01/14/2025 12:32:59 PM JMB105
HB1134
1 require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production
2 of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing board for the
3 attendance and testimony of witnesses and/or the production of evidence from
4 another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of
5 competent jurisdiction, according to that court’s practice and procedure in
6 considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing licensing
7 board shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees
8 required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses and/or
9 evidence are located.
10 5. Obtain and submit, for an APRN licensure applicant,
11 fingerprints or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of
12 Investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the
13 Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal background checks
14 and use the results in making licensure decisions.
15 6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the
16 affected APRN the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting
17 from any adverse action taken against that APRN.
18 7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings of another
19 party state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for
20 taking such adverse action.
21 b. If adverse action is taken by a home state against an APRN’s
22 multistate licensure, the privilege to practice in all other party states
23 under a multistate licensure privilege shall be deactivated until all
24 encumbrances have been removed from the APRN’s multistate license. All home
25 state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an APRN’s
26 multistate license shall include a statement that the APRN’s multistate
27 licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of
28 the order.
29 c. Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state’s decision
30 that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse
31 action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate
32 licensure privilege under the multistate license of any APRN for the duration
33 of the APRN’s participation in an alternative program.

1 Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of Information
2
3 a. All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure
4 information system of all APRNs, licensed registered nurses and licensed
5 practical/vocational nurses. This system will include information on the
6 licensure and disciplinary history of each APRN, as submitted by party
7 states, to assist in the coordinated administration of APRN licensure and
8 enforcement efforts.
9 b. The Commission, in consultation with the administrator of the
10 coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and
11 proper procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of
12 information under this Compact.
13 c. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated
14 licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant
15 investigative information, denials of applications (with the reasons for such
16 denials) and APRN participation in alternative programs known to the
17 licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic
18 and/or confidential under state law.
19 d. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party state
20 licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure
21 information system may designate information that may not be shared with non-
22 party states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the
23 express permission of the contributing state.
24 e. Any personally identifiable information obtained from the
25 coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board
26 shall not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or
27 individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state
28 contributing the information.
29 f. Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure
30 information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws
31 of the party state contributing the information shall be removed from the
32 coordinated licensure information system.

14 2. On the website of each licensing board or the publication in
15 which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.

32 challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If
33 the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
34 approval of the Commission.

8 2. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
9 process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities or
10 actions of the Commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a
11 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the

25 affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights,
26 privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the
27 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
28 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
29 default.
30 3. Termination of membership in this Compact shall be imposed
31 only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
32 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the
33 governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the
34 defaulting state’s licensing board, the defaulting state’s licensing board,
35 and each of the party states.

3 beyond the effective date of termination.
4 5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state
5 that is found to be in default or whose membership in this Compact has been
6 terminated, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the
7 defaulting state.
8 6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission
9 by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
10 federal district in which the Commission has its principal offices. The
11 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
12 reasonable attorneys’ fees.
13 c. Dispute Resolution
14 1. Upon request by a party state, the Commission shall attempt
15 to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among party states and
16 between party and non-party states.
17 2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
18 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
19 3. In the event the Commission cannot resolve disputes among
20 party states arising under this Compact:
21 i. The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an
22 arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the
23 Compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual
24 mutually agreed upon by the Compact administrators of all the party states
25 involved in the dispute.
26 ii. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be
27 final and binding.
28 d. Enforcement
29 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
30 shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.
31 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in
32 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
33 district in which the Commission has its principal offices against a party
34 state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this
35 Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include
36 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
21 01/14/2025 12:32:59 PM JMB105
HB1134
1 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
2 litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
3 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of
4 the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under
5 federal or state law.

22 continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state’s licensing
23 board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring

27 between a party state and a non-party state that does not conflict with the
28 provisions of this Compact.

30 this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any party state until it
31 is enacted into the laws of all party states.

9 circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact
10 and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
11 circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held to

17 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
18
19 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code Title 17, Chapter 87, is amended to add an
20 additional subchapter to read as follows:
21 Subchapter 9 — Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Compact
22
23 17-87-901. Text of compact.

28 ADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED NURSE COMPACT
29
30 ARTICLE I
31
32 Findings and Declaration of Purpose
33
34 a. The party states find that:
35 1. The health and safety of the public are affected by the
36 degree of compliance with APRN licensure requirements and the effectiveness
*JMB105*
01/14/2025 12:32:59 PM JMB105

HB1134
1 of enforcement activities related to state APRN licensure laws;
2 2. Violations of APRN licensure and other laws regulating the
3 practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;
4 3. The expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced
5 communication and intervention technologies as part of our nation’s health
6 care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among
7 states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation;
8 4. New practice modalities and technology make compliance with
9 individual state APRN licensure laws difficult and complex;
10 5. The current system of duplicative APRN licensure for APRNs
11 practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for healthcare
12 delivery systems, payors, state licensing boards, regulators and APRNs;
13 6. Uniformity of APRN licensure requirements throughout the
14 states promotes public safety and public health benefits as well as providing
15 a mechanism to increase access to care.
16 b. The general purposes of this Compact are to:
17 1. Facilitate the states’ responsibility to protect the public’s
18 health and safety;
19 2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the
20 areas of APRN licensure and regulation, including promotion of uniform
21 licensure requirements;
22 3. Facilitate the exchange of information between party states
23 in the areas of APRN regulation, investigation and adverse actions;
24 4. Promote compliance with the laws governing APRN practice in
25 each jurisdiction;
26 5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN
27 accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the
28 patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual
29 recognition of party state privileges to practice;
30 6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of
31 APRN licenses; and
32 7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by APRNs who
33 meet uniform licensure requirements.

1 the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the
2 client is located at the time service is provided.
3 k. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Compact, this
4 Compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for

19
20 a. Upon application for an APRN multistate license, the licensing
21 board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated
22 licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the
23 holder of a licensed practical/vocational nursing license, a registered
24 nursing license or an advanced practice registered nurse license issued by
25 any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or
26 multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse
27 action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege
28 held by the applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating in
29 an alternative program.
30 b. An APRN may hold a multistate APRN license, issued by the home
31 state, in only one party state at a time.
32 c. If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving between two
33 party states, the APRN must apply for APRN licensure in the new home state,
34 and the multistate license issued by the prior home state shall be
35 deactivated in accordance with applicable Commission rules.

7 d. If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving from a
8 party state to a non-party state, the APRN multistate license issued by the

12 ARTICLE V
13

19 privilege to practice within that party state.
20 i. Only the home state shall have power to take adverse
21 action against an APRN’s license issued by the home state.
22 ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state
23 licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct
24 that occurred outside of the home state as it would if such conduct had
25 occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its
26 own state laws to determine appropriate action.
27 2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an
28 APRN’s authority to practice within that party state.
29 3. Complete any pending investigations of an APRN who changes

9 01/14/2025 12:32:59 PM JMB105

HB1134
1 require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production
2 of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing board for the
3 attendance and testimony of witnesses and/or the production of evidence from
4 another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of
5 competent jurisdiction, according to that court’s practice and procedure in
6 considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing licensing
7 board shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees
8 required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses and/or
9 evidence are located.
10 5. Obtain and submit, for an APRN licensure applicant,
11 fingerprints or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of
12 Investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the
13 Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal background checks
14 and use the results in making licensure decisions.
15 6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the
16 affected APRN the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting
17 from any adverse action taken against that APRN.
18 7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings of another
19 party state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for
20 taking such adverse action.
21 b. If adverse action is taken by a home state against an APRN’s
22 multistate licensure, the privilege to practice in all other party states
23 under a multistate licensure privilege shall be deactivated until all
24 encumbrances have been removed from the APRN’s multistate license. All home
25 state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an APRN’s
26 multistate license shall include a statement that the APRN’s multistate
27 licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of
28 the order.
29 c. Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state’s decision
30 that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse
31 action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate
32 licensure privilege under the multistate license of any APRN for the duration
33 of the APRN’s participation in an alternative program.

6 caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error or omission that
7 occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable

6 Compact.
7 b. Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or
8 special meeting of the Commission.
9 c. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the
10 Commission, and at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which
11 the rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a
12 notice of proposed rulemaking:
13 1. On the website of the Commission; and
14 2. On the website of each licensing board or the publication in
15 which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.
16 d. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:
17 1. The proposed time, date and location of the meeting in which
18 the rule will be considered and voted upon;
19 2. The text of the proposed rule or amendment, and the reason
20 for the proposed rule;
21 3. A request for comments on the proposed rule from any
22 interested person; and

HB1134
1 2. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a
2 separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of
3 the Commission at hearings required by this section.
4 h. If no one appears at the public hearing, the Commission may proceed
5 with promulgation of the proposed rule.
6 i. Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business
7 on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission
8 shall consider all written and oral comments received.
9 j. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all administrators, take
10 final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of
11 the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the
12 rule.
13 k. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
14 consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for
15 comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided
16 in this Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the
17 rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days

30 results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing,
31 and delivered to the Commission, prior to the end of the notice period. If no
32 challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If
33 the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
34 approval of the Commission.

2 Oversight, Dispute Resolution and Enforcement
3
4 a. Oversight
5 1. Each party state shall enforce this Compact and take all
6 actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate this Compact’s purposes and
7 intent.
8 2. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
9 process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities or
10 actions of the Commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a
11 proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
12 Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this
13 Compact or promulgated rules.
14 b. Default, Technical Assistance and Termination
15 1. If the Commission determines that a party state has defaulted
16 in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact
17 or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:

19 other party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing
20 the default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and
21 ii. Provide remedial training and specific technical
22 assistance regarding the default.
23 2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the
24 defaulting state’s membership in this Compact may be terminated upon an
25 affirmative vote of a majority of the administrators, and all rights,
26 privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the
27 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
28 offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
29 default.
30 3. Termination of membership in this Compact shall be imposed
31 only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
32 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the
33 governor of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of the
34 defaulting state’s licensing board, the defaulting state’s licensing board,
35 and each of the party states.

3 beyond the effective date of termination.
4 5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state
5 that is found to be in default or whose membership in this Compact has been
6 terminated, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the
7 defaulting state.
8 6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission
9 by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
10 federal district in which the Commission has its principal offices. The
11 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
12 reasonable attorneys’ fees.
13 c. Dispute Resolution
14 1. Upon request by a party state, the Commission shall attempt
15 to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among party states and
16 between party and non-party states.
17 2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
18 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate.
19 3. In the event the Commission cannot resolve disputes among
20 party states arising under this Compact:
21 i. The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an
22 arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the
23 Compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual
24 mutually agreed upon by the Compact administrators of all the party states
25 involved in the dispute.
26 ii. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be
27 final and binding.
28 d. Enforcement
29 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
30 shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.
31 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in
32 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
33 district in which the Commission has its principal offices against a party
34 state that is in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this
35 Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include
36 both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
21 01/14/2025 12:32:59 PM JMB105

HB1134
1 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
2 litigation, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
3 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of
4 the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under
5 federal or state law.

12 Compact has been enacted into law in seven (7) party states for the sole
13 purpose of establishing and convening the Commission to adopt rules relating
14 to its operation.

16 initial adoption of the APRN uniform licensure requirements shall be subject

19 statute repealing the same. A party state’s withdrawal shall not take effect
20 until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.

22 continuing requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state’s licensing
23 board to report adverse actions and significant investigations occurring
24 prior to the effective date of such withdrawal or termination.
25 e. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate
26 or prevent any APRN licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
27 between a party state and a non-party state that does not conflict with the
28 provisions of this Compact.
29 f. This Compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to
30 this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any party state until it
31 is enacted into the laws of all party states.

33 invited to participate in the activities of the Commission, on a nonvoting
34 basis, prior to the adoption of this Compact by all states.

4 This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes
5 thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any
6 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be
7 contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States, or
8 if the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
9 circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact
10 and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
11 circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held to
12 be contrary to the constitution of any party state, this Compact shall remain
13 in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force
14 and effect as to the party state affected as to all severable matters.
