SB292
1 (b) An annual school election that is

6 SECTION 2. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
7 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that ensuring adequate
8 participation in elections preserves the public peace, health, and safety as
9 it ensures that the results of elections fairly reflect the will of voters;
10 that the holding of elections on a state holiday prevents many voters from
11 participating in an election and could potentially lead to election results
12 that do not reflect the overall will of voters; and that this act preserves
13 the public peace, health, and safety by ensuring that the annual school
14 election will not occur on a state holiday to allow appropriate participation
15 in the election to ensure fair and accurate results. Therefore, an emergency
16 is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the
17 preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective
18 on:
19 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
20 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
21 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
22 bill; or
23 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
24 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
