11 PROVISION. Upon seeking and receiving approval from the Chief Fiscal Officer
12 of the State and review and approval by the Arkansas Legislative Council or
13 Joint Budget Committee, the Director of the Department of Corrections -
14 Division of Community Correction is authorized to transfer appropriation from
15 any line item authorized in the State Operations and Operations - Special
16 Revenue Appropriations of this Act to any other line item authorized in the
17 State Operations and Operations - Special Revenue Appropriations of this Act.
18 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
19 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year
20 is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
21 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
22 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
23 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
24 has determined that the Department of Corrections - Division of Community
25 Correction may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided to
26 the Department of Corrections - Division of Community Correction authorizing
27 broad powers under this Section. Therefore, it is both necessary and
28 appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior
29 approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by
30 this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or
31 Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the
32 requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
33 is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire
34 section is void.
35 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
36 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

4 VEHICLE PURCHASE PROVISION. The Department of Corrections - Division of
5 Community Correction is hereby authorized to purchase motor vehicles from the
6 appropriations authorized for Capital Outlay in the State Operations and
7 Special Revenue Operations appropriations in this Act.
8 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
9 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
10
11 SECTION 9. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
12 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
13 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
14 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
15 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
16 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
17 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
18 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
19 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
20
21 SECTION 10. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
22 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
23 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
24 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
25 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
26 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
27 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
28 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
29
30 SECTION 11. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
31 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
32 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
33 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
34 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
35 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
36 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm

2 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
