29 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
30 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
31 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
32 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
33 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
34 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
35 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
