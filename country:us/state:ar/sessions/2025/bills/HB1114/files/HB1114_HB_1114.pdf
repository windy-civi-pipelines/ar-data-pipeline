HB1114
1 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations

9 SECTION 9. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
10 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
11 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
12 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
13 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
14 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
15 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
16 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
17 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
18 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
19 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
