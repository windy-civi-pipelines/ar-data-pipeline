2 SECTION 5. DO NOT CODIFY. Conditions and Audit. (a) Transfer of

16 SECTION 6. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
17 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
18 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
19 effectiveness of this Act upon passage and approval is essential to allow
20 transfers which can provide an additional funding mechanism for the
21 construction and operation of a state prison, as well as to address
22 unforeseen needs, and a delay in its effectiveness could work irreparable
23 harm upon the proper transfer of funds, administration and provision of
24 essential governmental programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared
25 to exist and this Act being necessary for the immediate preservation of the
26 public peace, health, and safety shall be in full force and effect upon
27 passage and approval. If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the
28 Governor, it shall become effective on the expiration of the period of time
29 during which the Governor may veto the bill. If the bill is vetoed by the
30 Governor and the veto is overridden, it shall become effective on the date
31 the last house overrides the veto.
