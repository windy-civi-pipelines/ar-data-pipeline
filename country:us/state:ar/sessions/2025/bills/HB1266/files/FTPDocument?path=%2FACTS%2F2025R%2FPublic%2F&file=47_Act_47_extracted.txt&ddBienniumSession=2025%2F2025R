HB1266
1 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
2 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
3 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
4 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary

10
11 SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General

14 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
15 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget

18 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
19
20 SECTION 8. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
21 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
22 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
23 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
24 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
25 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
26 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
27 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
28 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
29 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
30 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.

HB1266
1 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
2 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
3 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
4 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
5 Procedures and Restrictions Act, the Higher Education Expenditure Restriction

20 SECTION 8. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
21 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
22 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
23 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
24 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
25 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
26 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
27 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
28 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
29 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
30 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
