8 SECTION 5. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
9 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the Safe Schools Initiative
10 Act requires public schools to establish behavioral threat assessment teams
11 to address public school safety and security; that behavioral threat
12 assessment teams established by public schools shall follow best practices
13 for team composition and process; that student mental health poses an ongoing
14 crisis and can pose immediate threats in public schools; that public schools
15 are consistently identifying certain students as imminent threats, but day
16 treatment and mental health placements and services are unavailable for
17 students who need these placements and services; and that this act is
18 immediately necessary to ensure that the Department of Human Services and the
19 Department of Education establish regional behavioral health programs in
20 order to address immediate public school safety and security needs.
21 Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately
22 necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall
23 become effective on:
24 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
25 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
26 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
27 bill; or
28 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
29 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
