3 apportioned among insurers by the Board of Directors of the Arkansas
4 Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool.
5 (3) Each insurer's assessment shall be determined by multiplying

7 this section by a fraction, the numerator of which equals that insurer's
8 premium and subscriber contract charges for health insurance written in the
9 state during the preceding calendar year and the denominator of which equals
10 the total of all health insurance premiums by all insurers.
11 (4)(A) If assessments or other funds received under either
12 subdivision (b)(9) of this section or subsection (e) of this section
13 [repealed], or both, or any combination of the assessments and funds exceed
14 the pool's actual losses and administrative expenses, the excess shall be
15 held at interest and used by the board to offset future losses or to reduce
16 future assessments.
17 (B) As used in this subsection, “future losses” includes
18 reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

23 abatement or deferment of all or part of an assessment imposed by the board.
24 (ii) The commissioner may abate or defer, in whole or
25 in part, the assessment if, in the opinion of the commissioner, payment of
26 the assessment would endanger the ability of the insurer to fulfill its
27 contractual obligations.
28 (B)(i) In the event an assessment against an insurer is
29 abated or deferred, in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment
30 is abated or deferred shall be assessed against the other insurers in a
31 manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this
32 subsection.
33 (ii) The insurer receiving the abatement or deferment
34 shall remain liable to the plan for the deficiency for four (4) years.
35 (7) For all assessments issued by the board, beginning January

16 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291
HB1595
1 entities defined as an insurer in § 23-79-503 shall be subject to assessment.
2 (8) In the event the board fails to act within a reasonable
3 period of time to recoup by assessment any deficit incurred by the pool, the
4 commissioner shall have all the powers and duties of the board under this
5 chapter with respect to assessing insurers.
6 (9) The General Assembly further intends that the pool be
7 eligible for, and for the pool, its board, or other officers of state
8 government, as appropriate, to take steps necessary to obtain federal grant
9 funds to offset losses of the pool, including any funds made available under
10 the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act of 2002.
11 (c) Assessment Offsets.
12 (1) Any assessment may be offset in an amount equal to the
13 amount of the assessment paid to the pool against the premium tax payable by
14 that insurer for the year in which the assessment is levied or for the four
15 (4) years subsequent to that year.
16 (2) No offset shall be allowed for any penalty assessed under
17 subdivision (d)(1) of this section.
18 (d)(1) All assessments and fees shall be due and payable upon receipt
19 and shall be delinquent if not paid within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
20 the notice by the insurer.
21 (2) Failure to timely pay the assessment will automatically
22 subject the insurer to a ten percent (10%) penalty, which will be due and
23 payable within the next thirty-day period.
24 (3) The board and the commissioner shall have the authority to
25 enforce the collection of the assessment and penalty in accordance with the
26 provisions of this subchapter and the Arkansas Insurance Code.
27 (4) The board may waive the penalty authorized by this

HB1595
1 than one million dollars ($1,000,000) and shall not exceed three million
2 dollars ($3,000,000).
3 (b) In establishing the plan coverage, the board shall take into
4 consideration the levels of health insurance provided in the state and
5 medical economic factors as may be deemed appropriate and promulgate
6 benefits, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance factors, exclusions, and
7 limitations determined to be generally reflective of and commensurate with
8 health insurance provided through a representative number of large employers
9 in the state.
10 (c) The board may adjust any deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance
11 factors annually according to the medical component of the Consumer Price
12 Index for All Urban Consumers.
13 (d) Nonduplication of Benefits.
14 (1)(A) The pool shall be payer of last resort of benefits
15 whenever any other benefit or source of third-party payment is available.
16 (B) Benefits otherwise payable under plan coverage shall
17 be reduced by all amounts paid or payable through any other health insurance
18 or any other source providing benefits because of a sickness or injury and by
19 all hospital and medical expense benefits paid or payable under any workers'
20 compensation coverage, automobile medical payment, or liability insurance
21 whether provided on the basis of fault or nonfault and by any hospital or
22 medical benefits paid or payable under or provided pursuant to any state or
23 federal law or program.
24 (2) The pool shall have a cause of action against a covered
25 person for the recovery of the amount of benefits paid that are not covered
26 by the pool. Benefits due from the pool may be reduced or refused as a set-
27 off against any amount recoverable under this subdivision (d)(2).
28 (e) Right of Subrogation — Recoveries.
29 (1)(A) Whenever the pool has paid benefits because of sickness
30 or an injury to any covered person resulting from a third party's wrongful
31 act or negligence or for which an insurance company or self-insured entity is
32 liable in accordance with the provisions of any policy of insurance, and the
33 covered person has recovered or may recover damages from a third party that
34 is liable for damages, the pool shall have the right to recover the benefits
35 it paid from any amounts that the covered person has received or may receive
36 regardless of the date of the sickness or injury or the date of any
27 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291
HB1595
1 settlement, judgment, or award resulting from the sickness or injury.
2 (B) The pool shall be subrogated to any right of recovery
3 the covered person may have under the terms of any private or public
4 healthcare coverage or liability coverage including coverage under a workers'
5 compensation act without the necessity of assignment of claim or other
6 authorization to secure the right of recovery.
7 (C) To enforce its subrogation right, the pool may:
8 (i) Intervene or join in an action or proceeding
9 brought by the covered person or his or her personal representative,
10 including his or her guardian, conservator, estate, dependents, or survivors,
11 against any third party or the third party's insurance carrier or self-
12 insured entity that may be liable; or
13 (ii) Institute and prosecute legal proceedings
14 against any third party or the third party's insurance carrier or self-
15 insured entity that may be liable for the sickness or injury in an
16 appropriate court either in the name of the pool or in the name of the
17 covered person or his or her personal representative including his or her
18 guardian, conservator, estate, dependents, or survivors.
19 (2)(A)(i) If any action or claim is brought by or on behalf of a
20 covered person against a third party or the third party's insurance carrier
21 or self-insured entity, the covered person or his or her personal
22 representative, including his or her guardian, conservator, estate,
23 dependents, or survivors, shall notify the pool by personal service or
24 registered mail of the action or claim and of the name of the court in which
25 the action or claim is brought, filing proof thereof in the action or claim.
26 (ii) The pool may, at any time thereafter, join in
27 the action or claim upon its motion so that all orders of court after hearing
28 and judgment shall be made for its protection.
29 (B) No release or settlement of a claim for damages and no
30 satisfaction of judgment in the action shall be valid without the written
31 consent of the pool to the extent of its interest in the settlement or
32 judgment and of the covered person or his or her personal representative.
33 (3)(A) In the event that the covered person or his or her
34 personal representative fails to institute a proceeding against any
35 appropriate third party before the fifth month before the action would be
36 barred, the pool, in its own name or in the name of the covered person or
28 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291
HB1595
1 personal representative, may commence a proceeding against any appropriate
2 third party for the recovery of damages on account of any sickness, injury,
3 or death to the covered person.
4 (B) The covered person shall cooperate in doing what is
5 reasonably necessary to assist the pool in any recovery and shall not take
6 any action that would prejudice the pool's right to recovery.
7 (C) The pool shall pay to the covered person or his or her
8 personal representative all sums collected from any third party by judgment
9 or otherwise in excess of amounts paid in benefits under the pool and amounts
10 paid or to be paid as costs, attorney's fees, and reasonable expenses
11 incurred by the pool in making the collection or enforcing the judgment.
12 (4)(A)(i) In the event of judgment or award in either a suit or
13 claim against a third party, the court shall first order paid from any
14 judgment or award the reasonable litigation expenses incurred in preparation
15 and prosecution of the action or claim, together with reasonable attorney's
16 fees.
17 (ii) After payment of those expenses and attorney's
18 fees, the court shall apply out of the balance of the judgment or award an
19 amount sufficient to reimburse the pool the full amount of benefits paid on
20 behalf of the covered person under this subchapter, provided that the court
21 may reduce and apportion the pool's portion of the judgment proportionately
22 to the recovery of the covered person.
23 (B)(i) The burden of producing sufficient evidence to
24 support the exercise by the court of its discretion to reduce the amount of a
25 proven charge sought to be enforced against the recovery shall rest with the
26 party seeking the reduction.
27 (ii) The court may consider the nature and extent of
28 the injury, economic and noneconomic loss, settlement offers, comparative or
29 contributory negligence as it applies to the case at hand, hospital costs,
30 physician costs, and all other appropriate costs.
31 (C) The pool shall pay its pro rata share of the
32 attorney's fees based on the pool's recovery as it compares to the total
33 judgment.
34 (D) Any reimbursement rights of the pool shall take
35 priority over all other liens and charges existing under the laws of the
36 State of Arkansas.
29 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291
HB1595
1 (5) The pool may compromise or settle and release any claim for
2 benefits provided under this subchapter or waive any claims for benefits, in
3 whole or in part, for the convenience of the pool or if the pool determines
4 that collection will result in undue hardship upon the covered person.
5 (f) Preexisting Conditions.
6 (1) Except for federally eligible individuals or qualified trade
7 adjustment assistance eligible persons qualifying for plan coverage under §
8 23-79-509(b) or resident eligible persons or trade adjustment assistance
9 eligible persons who qualify for and elect to purchase the waiver authorized
10 in subdivision (f)(2) of this section, plan coverage shall exclude charges or
11 expenses incurred during the first six (6) months following the effective
12 date of coverage as to any condition if:
13 (A) The condition has manifested itself within the six-
14 month period immediately preceding the effective date of coverage in such a
15 manner as would cause an ordinary prudent person to seek diagnosis, care, or
16 treatment; or
17 (B) Medical advice, care, or treatment was recommended or
18 received within the six-month period immediately preceding the effective date
19 of the coverage.
20 (2) Waiver. The preexisting condition exclusions as set forth
21 in subdivision (f)(1) of this section will be waived to the extent to which
22 the resident eligible person or trade adjustment assistance eligible person:
23 (A) Has satisfied similar exclusions under any prior
24 individual health insurance coverage that was involuntarily terminated; and
25 (B)(i) Has applied for plan coverage not later than thirty
26 (30) days following the involuntary termination.
27 (ii) For each resident eligible person or trade
28 adjustment assistance eligible person who qualifies for and elects this
29 waiver, there shall be added on a prorated basis to each payment of premium a
30 surcharge of up to ten percent (10%) of the otherwise applicable annual
31 premium for as long as that individual's coverage under the plan remains in
32 effect or sixty (60) months, whichever is less.
33 (3)(A) Whenever benefits are due from the plan because of
34 sickness or an injury to a covered person resulting from a third party's
35 wrongful act or negligence and the covered person has recovered or may
36 recover damages from a third party or its insurance carrier or self-insured
30 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291
HB1595
1 entity, the plan shall have the right to reduce benefits or to refuse to pay
2 benefits that otherwise may be payable in the amount of damages that the
3 covered person has recovered or may recover regardless of the date of the
4 sickness or injury or the date of any settlement, judgment, or award
5 resulting from that sickness or injury.
6 (B)(i) During the pendency of any action or claim that is
7 brought by or on behalf of a covered person against a third party or its
8 insurance carrier or self-insured entity, any benefits that would otherwise
9 be payable except for the provisions of this subsection shall be paid if
10 payment by or for the third party has not yet been made and the covered
11 person or, if capable, that person's legal representative agrees in writing
12 to pay back properly the benefits paid as a result of the sickness or injury
13 to the extent of any future payments made by or for the third party for the
14 sickness or injury.
15 (ii) This agreement is to apply whether or not
16 liability for the payments is established or admitted by the third party or
17 whether those payments are itemized.
18 (C) Any amounts due the plan to repay benefits may be
19 deducted from other benefits payable by the plan after payments by or for the
20 third party are made.
21 (4) Benefits due from the plan may be reduced or refused as an
22 offset against any amount otherwise recoverable under this section.
23
24 23-79-511. Confidentiality.
25 (a)(1) All steps necessary under state and federal law to protect
26 confidentiality of applicants and covered persons shall be undertaken by the
27 Board of Directors of the Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool to
28 prevent the identification of individual records of covered persons under the
29 plan, rejected by the plan, or who may become ineligible for further
30 participation in the plan.
31 (2) Procedures shall be written by the board to assure the
32 confidentiality of records of persons covered under, rejected by, or who
33 became ineligible for further participation in the plan when gathering and
34 submitting data to the board or any other entity.
35 (b) Any information submitted to the board by hospitals or any other
36 provider pursuant to this subchapter from which the identity of a particular
31 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291
HB1595
1 individual can be determined shall be privileged and confidential and shall
2 not be disclosed in any manner. The foregoing includes, but shall not be
3 limited to, disclosure, inspection, or copying under the Freedom of
4 Information Act of 1967, § 25-19-101 et seq.
5
6 23-79-512. Collective action.
7 Neither the participation in the plan as insurers, the establishment of
8 rates, forms, or procedures nor any other joint or collective action required
9 by this subchapter shall be the basis of any legal action, criminal or civil
10 liability, or penalty against the plan or any insurer.
11
12 23-79-513. Unfair referral to plan — Prohibited practices by
13 employers.
14 (a) It shall constitute an unfair trade practice under the Trade
15 Practices Act, § 23-66-201 et seq., for an insurer, agent, broker, or third-
16 party administrator to refer an individual to the Arkansas Comprehensive
17 Health Insurance Pool or arrange for an individual to apply to the pool for
18 the purpose of:
19 (1) Separating the individual from group health insurance
20 coverage provided by a group health plan; or
21 (2) Facilitating enrollment in the pool by any of the following
22 individuals associated with an employer, with the knowledge that the employer
23 intends to pay or is paying all or part of the premium payments owed by the
24 individual for pool coverage:
25 (A) An employee of the employer;
26 (B) A retired employee of the employer; or
27 (C) A dependent of an employee or retired employee of the
28 employer.
29 (b) Because pool coverage is not intended to cover participants who
30 are eligible for a group health plan, an individual described in subdivision
31 (a)(2) of this section is not eligible:
32 (1) For pool coverage if the employer associated with the
33 applicant intends to pay for all or part of the pool premium payments for the
34 individual; or
35 (2) To continue pool coverage if the employer associated with
36 the individual directly or indirectly pays all or part of the pool premium
32 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291
HB1595
1 payments for the individual.
2
3 23-79-514. [Repealed.]
4
5 23-79-515. Orderly cessation of operations.
6 (a)(1) The Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool shall cease
7 enrollment and coverage under the plan on and after January 1, 2014, as
8 required by federal law.
9 (2) After taking all reasonable steps, including those specified
10 in this section, to timely and efficiently assist in the transition of
11 individuals receiving plan coverage to the individual health insurance
12 market, the Board of Directors of the Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance
13 Pool shall cease operating the pool after paying health insurance claims for
14 plan coverage and meeting all other obligations of the board under this
15 section.
16 (b) The board may take all actions it deems necessary to:
17 (1) Cease enrollment for plan coverage effective December 1,
18 2013;
19 (2)(A) Terminate all existing plan coverage effective at the end
20 of the calendar day on December 31, 2013.
21 (B) The board shall provide at least ninety (90) days
22 notice to current policyholders of the termination; and
23 (3) Amend plan policies and provide adequate notice to
24 policyholders, agents, and providers that to be paid or reimbursed, a claim
25 for plan services is required to be filed by the earlier of one hundred
26 eighty (180) days after plan coverage ends or three hundred sixty-five (365)
27 days after the date of service giving rise to the claim.
28 (c) This section does not require the board to revise plan benefits to
29 comply with federal law or to maintain plan coverage for any individual after
30 December 31, 2013.
31 (d)(1) After all plan coverage terminates under this section, the
32 board shall take reasonable steps to wind up all significant operations of
33 the pool by December 31, 2014.
34 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, to
35 facilitate an efficient cessation of operations:
36 (A) The board may continue to use existing contractors
33 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291
HB1595
1 until cessation of operations without the need to issue competitive requests
2 for proposals;
3 (B) The board may continue to fund operations of this
4 subchapter under § 23-79-507;
5 (C) The board shall remain in effect:
6 (i) As provided by § 23-79-504(b); and
7 (ii) Until a judgment, order, or decree in any
8 action, suit, or proceeding commenced against or by the pool is fully
9 executed; and
10 (D)(i) The term of each current board member shall be
11 extended until the date the pool concludes all business as provided under
12 this section and the Insurance Commissioner certifies the cessations of
13 operations under subsection (g) of this section.
14 (ii) The term of a board member expires when the
15 commissioner certifies the cessations of operations under subsection (g) of
16 this section.
17 (e) On or before June 30, 2013, the board shall amend the plan of
18 operation to reflect the actions necessary to implement this section.
19 (f) If the board has excess funds after the cessation of operations of
20 the pool, the funds shall be returned to the general revenue funds of the
21 state.
22 (g)(1) On or before March 1, 2016, or a later date if necessary to
23 complete the cessation of operations of the pool, the board shall file a
24 report with the General Assembly and commissioner that reflects completion of
25 the requirements of this section and includes an independent auditor's report
26 on the financial statements of the pool.
27 (2) If satisfied upon review of the report that the board has
28 complied with this section and accomplished the pool's cessation of
29 operations in a reasonable manner, the commissioner shall certify that the
30 business of the pool has concluded in accordance with this section and
31 publish the certification on the State Insurance Department website.
32 (h) Upon certification under subsection (g) of this section, the
33 operations of the pool are suspended indefinitely unless reactivated by the
34 General Assembly.
35 (i) The commissioner may address any matters regarding the pool
36 arising after the certification under subsection (g) of this section, and the
34 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291
HB1595
1 Attorney General shall defend a legal action filed after the certification,
2 including seeking the dismissal of the action under § 23-79-516 or for any
3 other purpose.
4 (j) Unless inconsistent with this section, the remainder of this
5 subchapter continues to apply to the pool and the board.
6
7 23-79-516. Statute of limitations and repose.
8 Because winding up the operations of the Arkansas Comprehensive Health
9 Insurance Pool requires the expeditious determination of its outstanding
10 liabilities, a cause of action against the pool or the Board of Directors of
11 the Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool shall be commenced within
12 the earlier of one (1) year after the cause of action accrues or December 31,
13 2015.
14
15 23-79-517. Individuals moving to Arkansas and previously covered by
16 another qualified high-risk pool.
17 (a) Notwithstanding § 23-79-510(f), if a resident eligible person is
18 eligible for plan coverage because the person previously was covered under a
19 qualified high-risk pool of another state, a preexisting condition exclusion
20 otherwise applicable to the resident eligible person:
21 (1) Shall be reduced by each month of coverage in which the
22 resident eligible person was subject to a preexisting condition exclusion in
23 the other state's qualified high-risk pool; or
24 (2) Does not apply if the resident eligible person was not
25 subject to a preexisting condition exclusion in the other state's qualified
26 high-risk pool.
27 (b) This section expires on the last day an individual may be enrolled
28 into plan coverage under this subchapter.

34 shall remain liable to the plan for the deficiency for four (4) years.

7 eligible for, and for the pool, its board, or other officers of state

15 (4) years subsequent to that year.
16 (2) No offset shall be allowed for any penalty assessed under
17 subdivision (d)(1) of this section.
18 (d)(1) All assessments and fees shall be due and payable upon receipt
19 and shall be delinquent if not paid within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
20 the notice by the insurer.
21 (2) Failure to timely pay the assessment will automatically
22 subject the insurer to a ten percent (10%) penalty, which will be due and
23 payable within the next thirty-day period.
24 (3) The board and the commissioner shall have the authority to
25 enforce the collection of the assessment and penalty in accordance with the
26 provisions of this subchapter and the Arkansas Insurance Code.

24 (U) Any expense or charge for procedures, treatments,
25 equipment, or services that are provided in special settings for research

28 appropriate national medical specialty college for general use within the
29 medical community;
30 (V) Such additional exclusions deemed appropriate by the
31 board in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section;

1 than one million dollars ($1,000,000) and shall not exceed three million
2 dollars ($3,000,000).
3 (b) In establishing the plan coverage, the board shall take into
4 consideration the levels of health insurance provided in the state and
5 medical economic factors as may be deemed appropriate and promulgate
6 benefits, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance factors, exclusions, and
7 limitations determined to be generally reflective of and commensurate with
8 health insurance provided through a representative number of large employers
9 in the state.
10 (c) The board may adjust any deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance
11 factors annually according to the medical component of the Consumer Price
12 Index for All Urban Consumers.

14 (1)(A) The pool shall be payer of last resort of benefits
15 whenever any other benefit or source of third-party payment is available.
16 (B) Benefits otherwise payable under plan coverage shall
17 be reduced by all amounts paid or payable through any other health insurance

20 compensation coverage, automobile medical payment, or liability insurance
21 whether provided on the basis of fault or nonfault and by any hospital or
22 medical benefits paid or payable under or provided pursuant to any state or
23 federal law or program.
24 (2) The pool shall have a cause of action against a covered
25 person for the recovery of the amount of benefits paid that are not covered
26 by the pool. Benefits due from the pool may be reduced or refused as a set-
27 off against any amount recoverable under this subdivision (d)(2).
28 (e) Right of Subrogation — Recoveries.
29 (1)(A) Whenever the pool has paid benefits because of sickness
30 or an injury to any covered person resulting from a third party's wrongful
31 act or negligence or for which an insurance company or self-insured entity is
32 liable in accordance with the provisions of any policy of insurance, and the
33 covered person has recovered or may recover damages from a third party that
34 is liable for damages, the pool shall have the right to recover the benefits
35 it paid from any amounts that the covered person has received or may receive
36 regardless of the date of the sickness or injury or the date of any
27 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291

HB1595
1 settlement, judgment, or award resulting from the sickness or injury.
2 (B) The pool shall be subrogated to any right of recovery
3 the covered person may have under the terms of any private or public
4 healthcare coverage or liability coverage including coverage under a workers'
5 compensation act without the necessity of assignment of claim or other
6 authorization to secure the right of recovery.
7 (C) To enforce its subrogation right, the pool may:
8 (i) Intervene or join in an action or proceeding
9 brought by the covered person or his or her personal representative,
10 including his or her guardian, conservator, estate, dependents, or survivors,
11 against any third party or the third party's insurance carrier or self-
12 insured entity that may be liable; or
13 (ii) Institute and prosecute legal proceedings
14 against any third party or the third party's insurance carrier or self-
15 insured entity that may be liable for the sickness or injury in an
16 appropriate court either in the name of the pool or in the name of the
17 covered person or his or her personal representative including his or her
18 guardian, conservator, estate, dependents, or survivors.
19 (2)(A)(i) If any action or claim is brought by or on behalf of a
20 covered person against a third party or the third party's insurance carrier
21 or self-insured entity, the covered person or his or her personal
22 representative, including his or her guardian, conservator, estate,
23 dependents, or survivors, shall notify the pool by personal service or
24 registered mail of the action or claim and of the name of the court in which
25 the action or claim is brought, filing proof thereof in the action or claim.
26 (ii) The pool may, at any time thereafter, join in
27 the action or claim upon its motion so that all orders of court after hearing
28 and judgment shall be made for its protection.
29 (B) No release or settlement of a claim for damages and no
30 satisfaction of judgment in the action shall be valid without the written
31 consent of the pool to the extent of its interest in the settlement or
32 judgment and of the covered person or his or her personal representative.
33 (3)(A) In the event that the covered person or his or her
34 personal representative fails to institute a proceeding against any
35 appropriate third party before the fifth month before the action would be
36 barred, the pool, in its own name or in the name of the covered person or
28 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291

HB1595
1 personal representative, may commence a proceeding against any appropriate
2 third party for the recovery of damages on account of any sickness, injury,
3 or death to the covered person.
4 (B) The covered person shall cooperate in doing what is
5 reasonably necessary to assist the pool in any recovery and shall not take
6 any action that would prejudice the pool's right to recovery.
7 (C) The pool shall pay to the covered person or his or her
8 personal representative all sums collected from any third party by judgment
9 or otherwise in excess of amounts paid in benefits under the pool and amounts
10 paid or to be paid as costs, attorney's fees, and reasonable expenses
11 incurred by the pool in making the collection or enforcing the judgment.
12 (4)(A)(i) In the event of judgment or award in either a suit or
13 claim against a third party, the court shall first order paid from any
14 judgment or award the reasonable litigation expenses incurred in preparation
15 and prosecution of the action or claim, together with reasonable attorney's
16 fees.
17 (ii) After payment of those expenses and attorney's
18 fees, the court shall apply out of the balance of the judgment or award an
19 amount sufficient to reimburse the pool the full amount of benefits paid on
20 behalf of the covered person under this subchapter, provided that the court
21 may reduce and apportion the pool's portion of the judgment proportionately
22 to the recovery of the covered person.
23 (B)(i) The burden of producing sufficient evidence to
24 support the exercise by the court of its discretion to reduce the amount of a
25 proven charge sought to be enforced against the recovery shall rest with the
26 party seeking the reduction.
27 (ii) The court may consider the nature and extent of
28 the injury, economic and noneconomic loss, settlement offers, comparative or
29 contributory negligence as it applies to the case at hand, hospital costs,
30 physician costs, and all other appropriate costs.
31 (C) The pool shall pay its pro rata share of the
32 attorney's fees based on the pool's recovery as it compares to the total
33 judgment.
34 (D) Any reimbursement rights of the pool shall take
35 priority over all other liens and charges existing under the laws of the
36 State of Arkansas.
29 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291

HB1595
1 (5) The pool may compromise or settle and release any claim for
2 benefits provided under this subchapter or waive any claims for benefits, in
3 whole or in part, for the convenience of the pool or if the pool determines
4 that collection will result in undue hardship upon the covered person.
5 (f) Preexisting Conditions.
6 (1) Except for federally eligible individuals or qualified trade
7 adjustment assistance eligible persons qualifying for plan coverage under §
8 23-79-509(b) or resident eligible persons or trade adjustment assistance
9 eligible persons who qualify for and elect to purchase the waiver authorized
10 in subdivision (f)(2) of this section, plan coverage shall exclude charges or
11 expenses incurred during the first six (6) months following the effective
12 date of coverage as to any condition if:
13 (A) The condition has manifested itself within the six-
14 month period immediately preceding the effective date of coverage in such a
15 manner as would cause an ordinary prudent person to seek diagnosis, care, or
16 treatment; or
17 (B) Medical advice, care, or treatment was recommended or
18 received within the six-month period immediately preceding the effective date
19 of the coverage.
20 (2) Waiver. The preexisting condition exclusions as set forth
21 in subdivision (f)(1) of this section will be waived to the extent to which
22 the resident eligible person or trade adjustment assistance eligible person:
23 (A) Has satisfied similar exclusions under any prior
24 individual health insurance coverage that was involuntarily terminated; and
25 (B)(i) Has applied for plan coverage not later than thirty
26 (30) days following the involuntary termination.
27 (ii) For each resident eligible person or trade
28 adjustment assistance eligible person who qualifies for and elects this
29 waiver, there shall be added on a prorated basis to each payment of premium a
30 surcharge of up to ten percent (10%) of the otherwise applicable annual
31 premium for as long as that individual's coverage under the plan remains in
32 effect or sixty (60) months, whichever is less.
33 (3)(A) Whenever benefits are due from the plan because of
34 sickness or an injury to a covered person resulting from a third party's
35 wrongful act or negligence and the covered person has recovered or may
36 recover damages from a third party or its insurance carrier or self-insured
30 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291

HB1595
1 entity, the plan shall have the right to reduce benefits or to refuse to pay
2 benefits that otherwise may be payable in the amount of damages that the
3 covered person has recovered or may recover regardless of the date of the
4 sickness or injury or the date of any settlement, judgment, or award
5 resulting from that sickness or injury.
6 (B)(i) During the pendency of any action or claim that is
7 brought by or on behalf of a covered person against a third party or its
8 insurance carrier or self-insured entity, any benefits that would otherwise
9 be payable except for the provisions of this subsection shall be paid if
10 payment by or for the third party has not yet been made and the covered
11 person or, if capable, that person's legal representative agrees in writing
12 to pay back properly the benefits paid as a result of the sickness or injury
13 to the extent of any future payments made by or for the third party for the
14 sickness or injury.
15 (ii) This agreement is to apply whether or not
16 liability for the payments is established or admitted by the third party or
17 whether those payments are itemized.
18 (C) Any amounts due the plan to repay benefits may be
19 deducted from other benefits payable by the plan after payments by or for the
20 third party are made.
21 (4) Benefits due from the plan may be reduced or refused as an
22 offset against any amount otherwise recoverable under this section.
23
24 23-79-511. Confidentiality.
25 (a)(1) All steps necessary under state and federal law to protect
26 confidentiality of applicants and covered persons shall be undertaken by the
27 Board of Directors of the Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool to
28 prevent the identification of individual records of covered persons under the
29 plan, rejected by the plan, or who may become ineligible for further
30 participation in the plan.
31 (2) Procedures shall be written by the board to assure the
32 confidentiality of records of persons covered under, rejected by, or who
33 became ineligible for further participation in the plan when gathering and
34 submitting data to the board or any other entity.
35 (b) Any information submitted to the board by hospitals or any other
36 provider pursuant to this subchapter from which the identity of a particular
31 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291

HB1595
1 individual can be determined shall be privileged and confidential and shall
2 not be disclosed in any manner. The foregoing includes, but shall not be
3 limited to, disclosure, inspection, or copying under the Freedom of
4 Information Act of 1967, § 25-19-101 et seq.
5
6 23-79-512. Collective action.
7 Neither the participation in the plan as insurers, the establishment of
8 rates, forms, or procedures nor any other joint or collective action required
9 by this subchapter shall be the basis of any legal action, criminal or civil
10 liability, or penalty against the plan or any insurer.
11
12 23-79-513. Unfair referral to plan — Prohibited practices by
13 employers.
14 (a) It shall constitute an unfair trade practice under the Trade
15 Practices Act, § 23-66-201 et seq., for an insurer, agent, broker, or third-
16 party administrator to refer an individual to the Arkansas Comprehensive
17 Health Insurance Pool or arrange for an individual to apply to the pool for
18 the purpose of:
19 (1) Separating the individual from group health insurance
20 coverage provided by a group health plan; or
21 (2) Facilitating enrollment in the pool by any of the following
22 individuals associated with an employer, with the knowledge that the employer
23 intends to pay or is paying all or part of the premium payments owed by the
24 individual for pool coverage:
25 (A) An employee of the employer;
26 (B) A retired employee of the employer; or
27 (C) A dependent of an employee or retired employee of the
28 employer.
29 (b) Because pool coverage is not intended to cover participants who
30 are eligible for a group health plan, an individual described in subdivision
31 (a)(2) of this section is not eligible:
32 (1) For pool coverage if the employer associated with the
33 applicant intends to pay for all or part of the pool premium payments for the
34 individual; or
35 (2) To continue pool coverage if the employer associated with
36 the individual directly or indirectly pays all or part of the pool premium
32 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291

HB1595
1 payments for the individual.
2
3 23-79-514. [Repealed.]
4
5 23-79-515. Orderly cessation of operations.
6 (a)(1) The Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool shall cease
7 enrollment and coverage under the plan on and after January 1, 2014, as
8 required by federal law.
9 (2) After taking all reasonable steps, including those specified
10 in this section, to timely and efficiently assist in the transition of
11 individuals receiving plan coverage to the individual health insurance
12 market, the Board of Directors of the Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance
13 Pool shall cease operating the pool after paying health insurance claims for
14 plan coverage and meeting all other obligations of the board under this
15 section.
16 (b) The board may take all actions it deems necessary to:
17 (1) Cease enrollment for plan coverage effective December 1,
18 2013;
19 (2)(A) Terminate all existing plan coverage effective at the end
20 of the calendar day on December 31, 2013.
21 (B) The board shall provide at least ninety (90) days
22 notice to current policyholders of the termination; and
23 (3) Amend plan policies and provide adequate notice to
24 policyholders, agents, and providers that to be paid or reimbursed, a claim
25 for plan services is required to be filed by the earlier of one hundred
26 eighty (180) days after plan coverage ends or three hundred sixty-five (365)
27 days after the date of service giving rise to the claim.
28 (c) This section does not require the board to revise plan benefits to
29 comply with federal law or to maintain plan coverage for any individual after
30 December 31, 2013.
31 (d)(1) After all plan coverage terminates under this section, the
32 board shall take reasonable steps to wind up all significant operations of
33 the pool by December 31, 2014.
34 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, to
35 facilitate an efficient cessation of operations:
36 (A) The board may continue to use existing contractors
33 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291

HB1595
1 until cessation of operations without the need to issue competitive requests
2 for proposals;
3 (B) The board may continue to fund operations of this
4 subchapter under § 23-79-507;
5 (C) The board shall remain in effect:
6 (i) As provided by § 23-79-504(b); and
7 (ii) Until a judgment, order, or decree in any
8 action, suit, or proceeding commenced against or by the pool is fully
9 executed; and
10 (D)(i) The term of each current board member shall be
11 extended until the date the pool concludes all business as provided under
12 this section and the Insurance Commissioner certifies the cessations of
13 operations under subsection (g) of this section.
14 (ii) The term of a board member expires when the
15 commissioner certifies the cessations of operations under subsection (g) of
16 this section.
17 (e) On or before June 30, 2013, the board shall amend the plan of
18 operation to reflect the actions necessary to implement this section.
19 (f) If the board has excess funds after the cessation of operations of
20 the pool, the funds shall be returned to the general revenue funds of the
21 state.
22 (g)(1) On or before March 1, 2016, or a later date if necessary to
23 complete the cessation of operations of the pool, the board shall file a
24 report with the General Assembly and commissioner that reflects completion of
25 the requirements of this section and includes an independent auditor's report
26 on the financial statements of the pool.
27 (2) If satisfied upon review of the report that the board has
28 complied with this section and accomplished the pool's cessation of
29 operations in a reasonable manner, the commissioner shall certify that the
30 business of the pool has concluded in accordance with this section and
31 publish the certification on the State Insurance Department website.
32 (h) Upon certification under subsection (g) of this section, the
33 operations of the pool are suspended indefinitely unless reactivated by the
34 General Assembly.
35 (i) The commissioner may address any matters regarding the pool
36 arising after the certification under subsection (g) of this section, and the
34 02/25/2025 1:11:34 PM ANS291

HB1595
1 Attorney General shall defend a legal action filed after the certification,
2 including seeking the dismissal of the action under § 23-79-516 or for any
3 other purpose.
4 (j) Unless inconsistent with this section, the remainder of this
5 subchapter continues to apply to the pool and the board.
6
7 23-79-516. Statute of limitations and repose.
8 Because winding up the operations of the Arkansas Comprehensive Health
9 Insurance Pool requires the expeditious determination of its outstanding
10 liabilities, a cause of action against the pool or the Board of Directors of
11 the Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool shall be commenced within
12 the earlier of one (1) year after the cause of action accrues or December 31,
13 2015.
14
15 23-79-517. Individuals moving to Arkansas and previously covered by
16 another qualified high-risk pool.
17 (a) Notwithstanding § 23-79-510(f), if a resident eligible person is
18 eligible for plan coverage because the person previously was covered under a
19 qualified high-risk pool of another state, a preexisting condition exclusion
20 otherwise applicable to the resident eligible person:
21 (1) Shall be reduced by each month of coverage in which the
22 resident eligible person was subject to a preexisting condition exclusion in
23 the other state's qualified high-risk pool; or
24 (2) Does not apply if the resident eligible person was not
25 subject to a preexisting condition exclusion in the other state's qualified
26 high-risk pool.
27 (b) This section expires on the last day an individual may be enrolled
28 into plan coverage under this subchapter.
