20 the General Assembly. Such transfers may be made only after approval by the
21 Governor and after prior approval by the Arkansas Legislative Council or

24 projects be greater than that provided by the General Assembly for the
25 Department of Corrections.
26 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
27 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year

31 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
32 has determined that the Department of Corrections - Division of Correction
33 may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the
34 Department of Corrections authorizing broad powers under this Section.

16 by the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, shall have the
17 authority to instruct the division directors Department Secretary, to request
18 from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, a transfer of positions,
19 programs, funds, appropriations, and line-item appropriations within or

21 the divisions department. If it is determined that the requested transfer
22 should be made, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall then initiate the
23 necessary transfer documents to reflect the transfers upon the fiscal records
24 of the State Treasurer, the State Auditor, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the
25 State, and the Department of Corrections Divisions of Correction and
26 Community Correction. Provided, however, that the Board Department Secretary
27 shall be limited to submitting no more than two requests, encompassing a

14 has determined that the Department of Corrections Divisions of Correction and
15 the Division of Community Correction may operate more efficiently if some
16 flexibility is provided to the Board of Corrections authorizing broad powers
17 under the Reallocation of Resources provisions herein. Therefore, it is both
18 necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by
19 requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
20 as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative

As Engrossed: H3/12/25 HB1174
1 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
2 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
3 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
4 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
5 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
6
7 SECTION 32. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
8 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
9 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
10 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
11 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
12 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
13 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
14 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
15 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
16 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
17 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.

19 among the various capital improvements/construction projects authorized by
20 the General Assembly. Such transfers may be made only after approval by the
21 Governor and after prior approval by the Arkansas Legislative Council or

26 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
27 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year

29 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
30 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
31 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
32 has determined that the Department of Corrections - Division of Correction
33 may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the
34 Department of Corrections authorizing broad powers under this Section.
35 Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly

16 by the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, shall have the
17 authority to instruct the division directors Department Secretary, to request
18 from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, a transfer of positions,
19 programs, funds, appropriations, and line-item appropriations within or

21 the divisions department. If it is determined that the requested transfer
22 should be made, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall then initiate the
23 necessary transfer documents to reflect the transfers upon the fiscal records
24 of the State Treasurer, the State Auditor, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the
25 State, and the Department of Corrections Divisions of Correction and
26 Community Correction. Provided, however, that the Board Department Secretary
27 shall be limited to submitting no more than two requests, encompassing a

8 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of

14 has determined that the Department of Corrections Divisions of Correction and
15 the Division of Community Correction may operate more efficiently if some
16 flexibility is provided to the Board of Corrections authorizing broad powers
17 under the Reallocation of Resources provisions herein. Therefore, it is both
18 necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by
19 requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
20 as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative

30 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of

33 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
34 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
35 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
36 has determined that the Department of Corrections may operate more

7 SECTION 32. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
8 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
9 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
10 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
11 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
12 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
13 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
14 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
15 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
16 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
17 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
