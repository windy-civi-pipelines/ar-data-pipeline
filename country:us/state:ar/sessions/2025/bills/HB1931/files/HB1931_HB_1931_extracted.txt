21
22 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code Title 12, Chapter 29, is amended to add an
23 additional subchapter to read as follows:
24 Subchapter 9. — Recidivism Reduction System
25
26 12-29-901. Legislative findings and intent.
27 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
28 (1) Recidivism rates reflect not just the behavior of a person
29 after reentry into society, but the correctional system's response to that
30 person's behavior during his or her term of incarceration; and
31 (2) The recidivism rate for the Department of Corrections for
32 the 2019 cohort was forty-eight and three-tenths percent (48.3%), resulting
33 in anticipated costs for reincarceration of over one hundred forty million
34 dollars ($140,000,000) annually.
35 (b) The General Assembly intends for the Department of Corrections to:
36 (1) Harness the opportunity of incarceration by beginning
*CEB278*
04-07-2025 10:39:33 CEB278
As Engrossed: H4/7/25 HB1931
1 reentry preparation for those incarcerated upon the first day of
2 incarceration through the development and expansion of coordinated evidence-
3 based programming, educational systems, and reentry services that support
4 intended outcomes of incarceration, avert the costs of recidivism, and
5 enhance public safety; and
6 (2) Embrace a correctional philosophy that reentry preparation
7 must begin on the first day of incarceration and adopt policies and rules
8 that result in reduction of the recidivism rate of people released from the
9 Division of Correction and under the supervision of the Division of Community
10 Correction.
11
12 12-29-902. Definitions.
13 As used in this subchapter:
14 (1) "Case plan" means an individualized plan developed by the

16 meaningful activities that address the needs of an inmate and reduce an
17 inmate's risk of recidivism;
18 (2) "Program or meaningful activity" means an evidence-based activity
19 provided to an inmate to address factors that lead to recidivism.
20 (3) "Recidivism" means a criminal act that results in the rearrest,
21 reconviction, or return to incarceration of a person with a new sentence or
22 the revocation of parole or post-release supervision during a three-year-
23 period following the person's release from custody; and
24 (4) "Validated risk and needs assessment" means a standardized
25 evaluation process that quantifies an inmate's risk of recidivism.

27 12-29-903. Establishment.
28 (a)(1) There is established the Recidivism Reduction System within the
29 Department of Corrections.

31 than within the Division of the Correction or Division of Community

33 (b) The Secretary of the Department of Corrections shall develop and
34 implement the system so that the system:
35 (1) Includes a validated risk and needs assessment to be

1 distinguish the different rates of failure;

3 activities, through development of an individualized case plan;
4 (3) Provides for periodic reassessment of the recidivism risk of
5 each inmate using an appropriate reassessment tool;
6 (4) Provides evidence-based programming; and
7 (5) Incorporates incentives and disincentives to encourage an
8 inmate to participate in his or her case plan.
9 (c) The secretary may:
10 (1) Add components to the system beyond those required by this
11 subchapter to further enhance the system and achieve the desired correctional
12 outcomes; and

14 are offered and add any new program or meaningful activity necessary to
15 effectively implement this subchapter.

23 appropriate programs or meaningful activities to reduce the inmate's risk of
24 recidivism.
25 (2) The case plan shall:
26 (A) Serve as an individual road map tailored to an
27 inmate’s specific risks, needs, and time to serve including assigned programs
28 or meaningful activities;
29 (B) Be developed to ensure that an inmate receives the
30 appropriate services for his or her needs that are delivered with the
31 intensity and frequency necessary to reduce the inmate's risk of recidivism;
32 and
33 (C) Be updated after a reassessment under subsection (c)
34 of this section to reassign the inmate to appropriate programs or meaningful

16 individual risk of recidivism.

26 12-29-901. Legislative findings and intent.
27 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
28 (1) Recidivism rates reflect not just the behavior of a person
29 after reentry into society, but the correctional system's response to that
30 person's behavior during his or her term of incarceration; and
31 (2) The recidivism rate for the Department of Corrections for
32 the 2019 cohort was forty-eight and three-tenths percent (48.3%), resulting
33 in anticipated costs for reincarceration of over one hundred forty million
34 dollars ($140,000,000) annually.
35 (b) The General Assembly intends for the Department of Corrections to:
36 (1) Harness the opportunity of incarceration by beginning

As Engrossed: H4/7/25 HB1931
1 reentry preparation for those incarcerated upon the first day of
2 incarceration through the development and expansion of coordinated evidence-
3 based programming, educational systems, and reentry services that support
4 intended outcomes of incarceration, avert the costs of recidivism, and
5 enhance public safety; and
6 (2) Embrace a correctional philosophy that reentry preparation
7 must begin on the first day of incarceration and adopt policies and rules
8 that result in reduction of the recidivism rate of people released from the
9 Division of Correction and under the supervision of the Division of Community
10 Correction.
