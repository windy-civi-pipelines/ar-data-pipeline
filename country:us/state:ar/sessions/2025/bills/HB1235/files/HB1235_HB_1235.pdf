2 SECTION 6. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
3 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
4 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for

8 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
9 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.

11 SECTION 7. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
12 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
13 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
14 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
15 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
16 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
17 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
18 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
19 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
20 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
21 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
