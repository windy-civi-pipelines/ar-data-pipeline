18 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
19
20 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
21 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
22 (1) Arkansas’s healthcare providers are at a significant
23 disadvantage as a result of national reimbursement methodologies;
24 (2) Arkansas's healthcare providers receive some of the lowest
25 government and commercial reimbursement rates in the country;
26 (3) The cumulative impact of receiving some of the lowest
27 reimbursement rates in the country has resulted in scarce resources for
28 Arkansas’s healthcare systems;
29 (4) The disparities in payment:
30 (A) Greatly affect the financial stability of healthcare
31 providers; and
32 (B) Make it harder for Arkansas to:
33 (i) Attract and retain qualified healthcare
34 professionals; and
35 (ii) Maintain adequate facilities and equipment;
36 (5)(A) On December 10, 2024, the Rand Corporation published its
*ANS282*

As Engrossed: H4/8/25 HB1930
1 fifth study that analyzed states’ average reimbursement rates relative to
2 Medicare prices.
3 (B) This study found that Arkansas had the lowest
4 reimbursement rates in the nation with an overall relative rate below one
5 hundred seventy percent (170%) of Medicare prices while the national average
6 is two hundred fifty-four percent (254%) of Medicare prices; and
7 (6) The adjoining states to Arkansas all receive significantly
8 higher reimbursement rates than Arkansas, which further exacerbates the
9 healthcare disparities in Arkansas.
10 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that Arkansas
11 has an adequate healthcare system to provide healthcare for all Arkansans and
12 that Arkansas healthcare systems can recruit and retain a workforce and
13 maintain adequate infrastructure to treat the needs of Arkansans.
14
