22
23 17-95-1201. Text of compact.

27 INTERSTATE MEDICAL LICENSURE COMPACT
28
29 SECTION 1. PURPOSE
30 In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the
31 advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate
32 Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a
33 comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory
34 authority of state medical boards, provides a streamlined process that allows
35 physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the
36 portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The
*JMB272*
03-03-2025 13:52:45 JMB272
As Engrossed: S3/3/25 SB119
1 Compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a
2 state’s existing Medical Practice Act. The Compact also adopts the prevailing
3 standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where
4 the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and
5 therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state
6 medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that
7 participate in the Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse
8 action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a
9 physician through the procedures in the Compact.

33 SECTION 15. RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION

As Engrossed: S3/3/25 SB119
1 exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of
2 the purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an
3 action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or
4 effect.
5 (b) Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the Interstate
6 Commission shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially
7 conforms to the “Model State Administrative Procedure Act” of 2010, and
8 subsequent amendments thereto.
9 (c) Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule is promulgated, any
10 person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule in the United
11 States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district
12 where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, provided that the
13 filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from
14 becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a
15 substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the

20 SECTION 16. OVERSIGHT OF INTERSTATE COMPACT
21 (a) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state
22 government in each member state shall enforce the Compact and shall take all

26 authority to regulate the practice of medicine.
27 (b) All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules
28 in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to
29 the subject matter of the Compact which may affect the powers,
30 responsibilities or actions of the Interstate Commission.
31 (c) The Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all
32 services of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to
33 intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of
34 process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void as
35 to the Interstate Commission, the Compact, or promulgated rules.

8 offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact, and its
9 promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief
10 sought may including both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
11 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
12 costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney’s fees.
13 (c) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the

21 promulgated under the Compact.
22 (b) If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has
23 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the
24 Compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission shall:

26 member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default,

28 shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its
29 default; and
30 (2) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance
31 regarding the default.
32 (c) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting
33 state shall be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
34 majority of the Commissioners and all rights, privileges, and benefits
35 conferred by the Compact shall terminate on the effective date of
36 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
16 03-03-2025 13:52:45 JMB272
As Engrossed: S3/3/25 SB119
1 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.

15 state that has been found to be in default or which has been terminated from
16 the Compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the
17 Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.
18 (h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate
19 Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District
20 of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its
21 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
22 litigation including reasonable attorney’s fees.
23
24 SECTION 19. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

28
29 SECTION 1. PURPOSE
30 In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the
31 advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate
32 Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a

As Engrossed: S3/3/25 SB119
1 Compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a
2 state’s existing Medical Practice Act. The Compact also adopts the prevailing
3 standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where
4 the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and
5 therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state
6 medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that
7 participate in the Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse
8 action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a
9 physician through the procedures in the Compact.
