19 TRANSFER PROVISION. After receiving approval from the Chief Fiscal Officer
20 of the State, and prior review by the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint
21 Budget Committee, the Treasurer of State is authorized to transfer
22 appropriation from any line item authorized in Operations Appropriation of
23 the Treasurer's Office in this Act to any other line item authorized in
24 Operations Appropriation.
25 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
26 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
27
28 SECTION 5. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
29 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. SALARIES.
30 Employees of the Office of the Treasurer of State shall be eligible for cost-
31 of-living increases on July 1, in an amount equal to that granted to all
32 other state agency, board, commission, or institution of higher education
33 employees on those dates. Any additional adjustments in annual salary rates
34 for employees, labor market adjustments, merit pay adjustments or employee
35 retention, or recruitment requirements shall be made at the discretion of the
36 Treasurer. In addition, the Treasurer may implement a merit program to
3 04-07-2025 14:51:11 JAR032
As Engrossed: H4/7/25 HB1106
1 reward employees for exceptional service. In order that exceptionally well-
2 qualified personnel may be recruited and retained, the Office of the
3 Treasurer of State may exceed the maximum salary levels by no more than
4 twenty percent (20%) for no more than one-fourth (1/4) of the positions
5 authorized in the appropriation act after receiving approval from the
6 Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee. Salary payments in
7 accordance with this section shall not be restricted to maximum amounts
8 authorized by law.
9 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
10 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year
11 is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
12 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
13 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
14 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly has
15 determined that the Office of the Treasurer of State may operate more
16 efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the Office of the Treasurer of
17 State authorizing broad powers under this section. Therefore, it is both
18 necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by
19 requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
20 as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative
21 Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If
22 the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
23 Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
24 this entire section is void.
25 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
26 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
27
28 SECTION 6. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
29 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
30 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
31 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
32 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
33 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
34 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
35 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
36 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.

2 SECTION 7. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
3 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
4 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
5 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
6 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
7 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
8 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
9 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
10
11 SECTION 8. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
12 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
13 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
14 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
15 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
16 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
17 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
18 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
19 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
20 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
21 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
