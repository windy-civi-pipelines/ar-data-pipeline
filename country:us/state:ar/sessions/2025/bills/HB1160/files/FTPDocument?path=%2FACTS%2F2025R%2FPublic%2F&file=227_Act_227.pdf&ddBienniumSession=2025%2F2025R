6 SECTION 3. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
7 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the operations of a state
8 public retirement system are complex; that the Arkansas Teacher Retirement
9 System must be able to meet the needs of its members as anticipated by the
10 General Assembly; that certain provisions of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement
11 System Act, § 24-7-201 et seq., need immediate revision and updating to
12 address administrative complexities caused by these provisions and to bring
13 these provisions into conformance with sound public pension policy and
14 actuarial requirements; that the revisions and updates are of great
15 importance to members and covered employers of the Arkansas Teacher
16 Retirement System and to other citizens of the State of Arkansas; that as the
17 Arkansas Teacher Retirement System operates on a fiscal year of July 1 to
18 June 30, a July 1, 2025, effective date is necessary in order to allow the
19 provisions within this act to begin on the first day of the fiscal year and
20 to allow for a structured and proper administration of the procedures
21 referenced in this act; that the updates and revisions to the Arkansas
22 Teacher Retirement System Act are of great importance and necessary for
23 protecting member benefits and clarifying the reporting and contribution
24 requirements of employers participating in the Arkansas Teacher Retirement
25 System; and that this act is necessary in order to maintain an orderly system
26 of benefits for the members of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System.
27 Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary
28 for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, shall become
29 effective on July 1, 2025.
