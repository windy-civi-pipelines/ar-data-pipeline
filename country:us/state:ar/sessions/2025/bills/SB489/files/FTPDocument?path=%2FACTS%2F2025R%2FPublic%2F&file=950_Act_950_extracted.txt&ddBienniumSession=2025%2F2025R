30 Confederate States of America;
31 (2) Following the May 17, 1954, decision of the United States
32 Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, the school boards of
33 Fayetteville and Charleston voted to integrate their schools beginning in the
34 fall of 1954, with Fayetteville making the decision just four (4) days after

1 attended classes in Charleston with no publicity as the school board and the
2 superintendent persuaded the local newspaper and civic and business leaders
3 not to discuss their desegregation plans with out-of-town sources;
4 (4) When Fayetteville High School integrated on September 10,
5 1954, the Charleston School Board President revealed that Charleston had
6 peacefully integrated three (3) weeks earlier;
7 (5) While integration in Charleston and Fayetteville was spared
8 some of the problems experienced by other schools during the early days of

10 to play Charleston and Fayetteville as there were black players on the teams
11 and Charleston being excluded from some band competitions because of their
12 black band members;
13 (6) United States Senator Dale Bumpers, a former member of the
14 Charleston School Board, sponsored legislation in 1998 designating Charleston
15 High School as a National Commemorative Site; and
16 (7) It is appropriate to commemorate the historic achievement of
17 being the first school districts in the former Confederate States of America
18 to desegregate their schools by placing a monument on the State Capitol
19 grounds in recognition of the school districts in Charleston and
20 Fayetteville.
21 (b) It is the intent of this act to place a monument on the State
22 Capitol grounds in recognition of the historic desegregation of the
