26
27 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings.
28 The General Assembly finds that:
29 (1) Many electric vehicles are being made with components
30 created through the use of forced labor, including materials mined by Uyghur
31 and other Muslim minorities in the People's Republic of China's Xinjiang
32 Uyghur Autonomous Region;
33 (2) Concerns about the use of forced labor to create these
34 components and materials prompted the United States Government to pass the
35 Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, Pub. L. No. 117-78, with overwhelming
36 bipartisan support;
*JLL056*

As Engrossed: H4/3/25 HB1683
1 (3) Under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, Pub. L. No.
2 117-78, there is a rebuttable presumption that any product manufactured in
3 whole or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was produced by
4 forced labor;
5 (4) The United States Government recently restricted the
6 application of its newly created tax credits for electric vehicles so that
7 "[b]eginning in 2024, an eligible clean vehicle may not contain any battery
8 components that are manufactured by a foreign entity of concern, and
9 beginning in 2025, an eligible clean vehicle may not contain any critical
10 minerals that were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of
11 concern";
12 (5) The United States Government recently proposed a regulation
13 for another act that any company subject to the People's Republic of China's
14 jurisdiction will be defined as a "foreign entity of concern," which would
15 prevent federal tax credits from supporting sales of electric vehicles made
16 with battery components from entities of the People's Republic of China;
17 (6) Many electric vehicles are also being made with components
18 created through the use of oppressive child labor, most notably, through
19 cobalt ore mined in dangerous conditions by thousands of young children in
20 the Democratic Republic of the Congo and sent to the People's Republic of
21 China for use in manufacturing lithium-ion batteries;
22 (7) The United States Government recently concluded that
23 "downstream products containing lithium-ion batteries may be produced with an
24 input produced with child labor, such as electric cars";
25 (8) The use of forced labor is repugnant and deplorable,
26 violates basic human rights, constitutes unacceptable discrimination, and
27 damages free and fair competition; and
28 (9) State governments should take steps to ensure that taxpayer
29 dollars are not being used to pay for electric vehicles that may have been
30 partially manufactured through forced labor.
31
32 SECTION 2. Arkansas Code Title 25, Chapter 1, Subchapter 1, is amended
33 to add an additional section to read as follows:
34 25-1-130. Purchase of electric vehicle.

11 restraint; or
12 (iii) Means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law
13 or the legal process;

18 a person under the age of fourteen (14) years of age is employed in an
19 occupation hazardous for the employment of children, including without
20 limitation manufacturing or mining; and
21 (3) "Governmental entity" means a:
22 (A) State agency, including without limitation any

30 (b) A governmental entity shall not enter into a contract for the

33 vehicle in good faith provides the governmental entity a sworn certification
34 that certifies that no entity involved in the production of the electric
35 vehicle or the component of an electric vehicle being sold, including the

27 (d) This section applies to a procurement contract for an
