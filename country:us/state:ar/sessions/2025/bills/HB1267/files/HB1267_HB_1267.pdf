3 SECTION 6. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
4 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. ARKANSAS
5 CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL RESEARCH PROGRAM. In any fiscal year, if the funds
6 received by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences for the Arkansas
7 Biosciences Institute in the Arkansas Biosciences Institute appropriation in
8 this Act are less than the total amount appropriated, the University of
9 Arkansas for Medical Sciences shall provide no less than thirty-three and
10 one-third percent (33 and 1/3%) of the available funds for the Arkansas
11 Children's Hospital Research Program. Otherwise, the Arkansas Children’s
12 Hospital Research Program line item appropriation in the Arkansas Biosciences
13 Institute appropriation in this Act shall be funded in total or Arkansas
14 Children’s Hospital Chief Executive Officer may request that the University
15 of Arkansas for Medical Sciences transfer such funds each fiscal year from
16 the Arkansas Biosciences Institute Program Account to the Department of Human
17 Services Grants Fund Account. The transferred funds shall be used to match
18 federal funds used for Supplemental Medicaid payments to Arkansas Children’s
19 Hospital.
20 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
21 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
22
23 SECTION 7. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
24 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFER
25 RESTRICTIONS. The appropriations provided in this act shall not be
26 transferred under the provisions of Arkansas Code 19-4-522, but only as
27 provided by this act.
28 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
29 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
30
31 SECTION 8. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
32 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFER
33 PROVISIONS. The state-supported institution of higher education in this act
34 may transfer appropriations between the various line items within each
35 appropriation contained in this appropriation act. Such transfers shall be
36 made only after the approval of the Division of Higher Education and the
7 01/27/2025 1:55:09 PM HAR042

HB1267
1 Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, and the approval of the Legislative
2 Council or Joint Budget Committee.
3 The General Assembly has determined that the institution in this act could
4 be operated more efficiently if some flexibility is given to that institution
5 and that flexibility is being accomplished by providing authority to transfer
6 between items of appropriation made by this act. Since the General Assembly
7 has granted the institution broad powers under the transfer of
8 appropriations, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
9 Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the transfers by requiring
10 prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee in the
11 utilization of the transfer authority. Therefore, the requirement of
12 approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a
13 severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by the
14 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a
15 court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
16 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
17 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
18
19 SECTION 9. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
20 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
21 POSITIONS. (a) Nothing in this act shall be construed as a commitment of the
22 State of Arkansas or any of its agencies or institutions to continue funding
23 any position paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement in the event
24 that Tobacco Settlement funds are not sufficient to finance the position.
25 (b) State funds will not be used to replace Tobacco Settlement funds when
26 such funds expire, unless appropriated by the General Assembly and authorized
27 by the Governor.
28 (c) A disclosure of the language contained in (a) and (b) of this Section
29 shall be made available to all new hire and current positions paid from the
30 proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement by the Tobacco Settlement Commission.
31 (d) Whenever applicable the information contained in (a) and (b) of this
32 Section shall be included in the employee handbook and/or Professional
33 Services Contract paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement.
34 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
35 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

HB1267
1 SECTION 10. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
2 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
3 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds authorized by this act
4 shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency and funds made
5 available by law for the support of such appropriations; and the restrictions
6 of the State Purchasing Law, the General Accounting and Budgetary Procedures
7 Law, the Regular Salary Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors,
8 and other fiscal control laws of this State, where applicable, and
9 regulations promulgated by the Department of Finance and Administration, as
10 authorized by law, shall be strictly complied with in disbursement of said
11 funds.
12
13 SECTION 11. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
14 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
15 LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General Assembly that any funds
16 disbursed under the authority of the appropriations contained in this act
17 shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for which this act was
18 adopted, as evidenced by Initiated Act 1 of 2000, the Agency Requests,
19 Executive Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the
20 budget manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration,
21 letters, or summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas
22 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and
23 adoption.
24
25 SECTION 12. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
26 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
27 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
28 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
29 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
30 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
31 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
32 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
33 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
34 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
35 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
