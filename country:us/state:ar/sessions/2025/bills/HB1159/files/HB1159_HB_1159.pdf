1 (3) It has been estimated by law enforcement officials that six
2 percent (6%) of all robberies of businesses in the United States involve
3 retail convenience stores;
4 (4) Employees in the retail trade sector are at a higher risk of
5 violence and homicide than in other industry sectors, and within the retail
6 sector, employees in gasoline stations or retail convenience stores are at a
7 higher risk of violence and homicide compared with employees in other types
8 of retail and the overall workforce;
9 (5) According to 2021 Federal Bureau of Investigation crime
10 data, there were over twenty-two thousand seven hundred eighty-eight (22,788)
11 incidents of violent crime that occurred at retail convenience stores in the
12 United States, double the incidence of violent crime that occurred at retail
13 convenience stores in 2017, and represented three percent (3%) of the
14 nation's total violent crime statistics for 2021;
15 (6) The increase in nighttime robberies and other crimes at
16 retail convenience stores heightens the risk of danger, exposure to violent
17 incidents, and crime to consumers and employees;

20 of convenience stores during the nighttime hours, including Florida, Maine,
