25 allocated for community-based services under the appropriation for (i) the
26 Grants-in-Aid appropriation in this act, (ii) the Grants/Patient Services
27 Line in the Operations appropriation in this act, and (iii) the Inter-
28 Divisional Programs appropriation in this act, shall be used only to provide
29 services through private community based services licensed or certified by
30 the Arkansas Division of Developmental Disabilities Services (DDS) or
31 licensed or certified by a Provider-Led Arkansas Shared Savings Entity
32 (PASSE). Non-profit community-based programs licensed by the Division of
33 Developmental Disabilities Services are quasi-governmental instrumentalities

1 Arkansas. When licensed providers are involved in delivering services which
2 are Medicaid reimbursable, they must enroll as a provider with the Arkansas
3 Medicaid Program and must bill the Arkansas Medicaid Program for all covered
4 services for eligible individuals.
5 Services which are covered by the Arkansas State Medicaid Program,
6 including the Provider-Led Arkansas Shared Savings Entity (PASSE) model, will
7 be utilized to the maximum extent possible for any individual who is eligible
8 for Medicaid coverage. It is the intent of this section that DDS, as a
9 general policy, maximize the use of Medicaid funding available for
10 appropriate services.
11 Licensed private community providers funded from these appropriations for
12 community based services shall:
13 1. Screen each individual to whom services are provided for a determination
14 of eligibility or ineligibility for Medicaid coverage within thirty days of
15 the first date that services are provided.
16 2. Meet minimum standards of performance in the delivery of services to
17 people with disabilities as defined by the Department of Human Services -
18 Division of Developmental Disabilities Services.
19 3. Supply statistical and financial data to the Department of Human Services
20 - Division of Developmental Disabilities Services.
21 4. Establish and maintain a sound financial management system in accordance
22 with guidelines as set forth by the Department of Human Services.
23 5. Establish and maintain community support programs designed to provide
24 coordinated care and treatment to ensure ongoing involvement and
25 individualized services for persons with disabilities.
26 It is the intent of this section to insure that wherever possible and
27 appropriate, Medicaid funds are utilized.
28 Nothing in this Act shall prevent the Division or any provider from
29 extending emergency services when appropriate measures have been taken in a
30 timely manner to secure Medicaid eligibility.
31 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
32 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

2 Developmental Disabilities Services shall budget, allocate, and expend up to
3 one million dollars ($1,000,000) for the elimination of the Autism Waiver
4 Services Program waiting list.
5 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1,
6 2024 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

8 SECTION 12. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
9 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
10 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
11 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
12 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
13 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
14 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
15 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
16 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
17
18 SECTION 13. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
19 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
20 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
21 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
22 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
23 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
24 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
25 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
26
27 SECTION 14. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
28 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
29 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
30 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
31 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
32 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
33 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
34 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
35 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
36 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health

31 licensed or certified by a Provider-Led Arkansas Shared Savings Entity

1 Arkansas. When licensed providers are involved in delivering services which
2 are Medicaid reimbursable, they must enroll as a provider with the Arkansas
3 Medicaid Program and must bill the Arkansas Medicaid Program for all covered
4 services for eligible individuals.
5 Services which are covered by the Arkansas State Medicaid Program,
6 including the Provider-Led Arkansas Shared Savings Entity (PASSE) model, will
7 be utilized to the maximum extent possible for any individual who is eligible
8 for Medicaid coverage. It is the intent of this section that DDS, as a
9 general policy, maximize the use of Medicaid funding available for
10 appropriate services.
11 Licensed private community providers funded from these appropriations for
12 community based services shall:
13 1. Screen each individual to whom services are provided for a determination
14 of eligibility or ineligibility for Medicaid coverage within thirty days of
15 the first date that services are provided.
16 2. Meet minimum standards of performance in the delivery of services to
17 people with disabilities as defined by the Department of Human Services -
18 Division of Developmental Disabilities Services.
19 3. Supply statistical and financial data to the Department of Human Services
20 - Division of Developmental Disabilities Services.
21 4. Establish and maintain a sound financial management system in accordance
22 with guidelines as set forth by the Department of Human Services.
23 5. Establish and maintain community support programs designed to provide
24 coordinated care and treatment to ensure ongoing involvement and
25 individualized services for persons with disabilities.
26 It is the intent of this section to insure that wherever possible and
27 appropriate, Medicaid funds are utilized.
28 Nothing in this Act shall prevent the Division or any provider from
29 extending emergency services when appropriate measures have been taken in a
30 timely manner to secure Medicaid eligibility.
31 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
32 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

4 Services Program waiting list.
5 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1,
6 2024 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

8 SECTION 12. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
9 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
10 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
11 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
12 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
13 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
14 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
15 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
16 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
17
18 SECTION 13. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
19 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
20 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
21 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
22 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
23 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
24 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
25 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
26
27 SECTION 14. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
28 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
29 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
30 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
31 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
32 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
33 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
34 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
35 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
36 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
