8 (k) A canvasser who has filed a true affidavit under subsection (j) of

30 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the process for citizens to
31 propose initiated acts and amendments to the Arkansas Constitution is
32 critical to a well-functioning democracy in this state; that it is of the
33 utmost importance that the integrity of the initiative process be
34 strengthened through this act so that petitioners and voters maintain a high
35 degree of confidence in the soundness of their right to legislate as citizens
36 of Arkansas; and that this act is immediately necessary because any delay in

As Engrossed: H2/19/25 SB211

4 exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the preservation of the
5 public peace, health, and safety shall become effective on:
6 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
7 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
8 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
9 bill; or
