13 to the language of Title 19 and transferred certain material from Title 19 to
14 more appropriate titles of the Arkansas Code;
15 (3) The commission also asked the bureau to form a working group
16 of various state agencies, constitutional officers, and the Arkansas Bar
17 Association to review the proposed draft recodification of Title 19 for the
18 purposes of:
19 (A) Ensuring that only technical changes were made as part
20 of the recodification; and

29
30 19-3-201. Legislative intent.
31 The General Assembly recognizes that legislation considered by the
32 First Extraordinary Session of the Seventy-First General Assembly may remove
33 the penalty requirements for failure to pay property taxes by installments
34 and that this action may result in a reduction of property tax revenues
35 available to cities, counties, and school districts, thereby imposing a
36 financial hardship upon the cities, counties, and school districts during
65 03-04-2025 10:49:39 JLL144

As Engrossed: H2/20/25 S3/4/25 HB1508
1 portions of their calendar or fiscal year. It is, therefore, the intent of
2 this subchapter to authorize the State Board of Finance, in the manner
3 provided in this subchapter, to make temporary loans to cities, counties, and
4 school districts to assist in maintaining their average cash flow if there is
5 a material reduction in their cash flow resulting from legislation enacted by
6 the First Extraordinary Session of the Seventy-First General Assembly.
7
8 19-3-202. Procedure for obtaining and repaying loans.
9 (a)(1) The State Board of Finance may make temporary loans to cities,
10 counties, and school districts from average daily balances in the State
11 Treasury available to the board for investment purposes.
12 (2)(A) For a city, county, or school district to be eligible to
13 receive temporary loans under this subchapter, the city, county, or school
14 district shall prepare a schedule from each of the five (5) preceding
15 calendar or fiscal years.
16 (B) This schedule shall reflect the average monthly cash
17 flow derived from property tax sources and the proportion of property taxes
18 available during each month as they relate to the aggregate amount of
19 property taxes collected and available to the city, county, or school
20 district during the calendar or fiscal year, and the city, county, or school
21 district shall average the monthly cash flow percentages for the five-year
22 period.
23 (b)(1) If the board determines that the cash flow of the city, county,
24 or school district has fallen below the monthly average percentage cash flow
25 for property taxes available to the city, county, or school district for the
26 prior five (5) fiscal years and that the current level of cash flow is not
27 adequate to enable the city, county, or school district to maintain an
28 adequate level of services, the board may make temporary loans to the city,
29 county, or school district.
30 (2) These temporary loans may be in an aggregate amount no
31 greater than the difference between average monthly percentage cash flow of
32 the city, county, or school district for the preceding five (5) years for the
33 period and the actual percentage cash flow in the current tax year computed
34 on the basis of taxes collected in relation to the estimated tax collections
35 for the tax year.
36 (c)(1) All these temporary loans shall be repaid to the board upon
66 03-04-2025 10:49:39 JLL144

As Engrossed: H2/20/25 S3/4/25 HB1508
1 their maturity. The maturity of a temporary loan shall not be beyond the
2 last day of the calendar year in which the loan is made.
3 (2)(A) If a city, county, or school district fails or refuses to
4 pay any such temporary loan according to the repayment schedule agreed to by
5 the board or as set forth in this section, the board shall certify this fact
6 and the amount of the unpaid temporary loan to the Treasurer of State.
7 (B) The Treasurer of State shall withhold the amount of
8 the unpaid temporary loan from the next moneys available for distribution to
9 the city, county, or school district from state general revenues and shall
10 transfer the amount from the County Aid Fund, the Municipal Aid Fund, or the
11 Public School Fund, as the case may be, to the appropriate State Treasury
12 account or source from which the temporary loan was made.
13
14 19-3-203. Rules.
15 The State Board of Finance may promulgate appropriate rules for the
16 administration of this subchapter, including the establishment of the
17 necessary forms and loan instruments to be used in connection with making
18 loans under this subchapter.

As Engrossed: H2/20/25 S3/4/25 HB1508

2 (a) This subchapter is an addition to the General Accounting and
3 Budgetary Procedures Law, § 19-4-101 et seq., and other fiscal laws of this
4 state. This subchapter is enacted for the purpose of imposing additional
5 duties and responsibilities upon the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State to
6 monitor state expenditures and financial obligations in order to assure that
7 all state agencies, programs, and services plan and use the funds provided or
8 made available for the support of the essential services of government within
9 their respective jurisdictions. This monitoring shall be done without
10 incurring obligations or commitments that would exhaust the available funds
11 within a time frame of less than twelve (12) months or that would create
12 deficits.
13 (b) The General Assembly is cognizant of the economic recession that
14 has reduced the growth of state revenues that are available for the operation
15 of many of the programmed commitments or expansions of services of
16 government. By this subchapter the General Assembly intends to strengthen the
17 responsibilities and duties of the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State to
18 provide for the planned and orderly, yet rigid, enforcement of the various
19 laws of this state designed to protect against deficit spending.
20 (c) It is further the intent and purpose of this subchapter to mandate
21 that all public officials, administrators, and employees charged with the
22 responsibility of administering and disbursing state funds be held strictly
23 accountable for the administration of the programs under their jurisdiction.
24 Those officials, administrators, and employees shall periodically reevaluate
25 and modify, if necessary, the various programs and services under their
26 respective jurisdiction to assure the orderly providing of the greatest
27 possible level of essential services and programs on a regular twelve-month
28 basis, within the limitation of the funds available.
29 (d) The General Assembly further recognizes that many agencies may
30 have to evaluate and curtail projected or planned program expansions. Many
31 agencies may also have to exercise options to reduce the levels of existing
32 services or program commitments to keep the projected expenditures for the
33 programs or services within the limitations of funds estimated to be
34 available for the programs or services, as provided in this subchapter. It is
35 the intention of the General Assembly that each state agency review its
36 ongoing obligations and services and make the necessary adjustments to
166 03-04-2025 10:49:39 JLL144

18 and mandates of the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State to restrict or curtail
19 its financial obligations or program commitments as intended by this
20 subchapter, the executive head of the agency or members of the board or

11 shall open, tabulate, and compare bids, and award the contract to the lowest
12 responsible bidder.
13 (2) However, the state agency shall have the right to reject any
14 bids and to waive any formalities.
15 (c)(1) The successful bidder shall be required to furnish bonds to the
16 State of Arkansas, with corporate guaranty or indemnity sureties on the
17 bonds.
18 (2)(A) The bonds shall be both for the completion of the

7 percent (5%) of the amount of the bid.
8 (e)(1)(A) When it is obvious from examination of the bid document that
9 it was the intent of a bidder to submit a responsive bid and because of a
10 scrivener's error, the bid, if accepted, would create a serious financial
11 loss to the bidder, the Secretary of the Department of Transformation and
12 Shared Services may relieve the bidder from responsibility under his or her
13 bond and may reject the bid.

23 shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of the original work
24 papers, documents, or materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to
25 be withdrawn; and
26 (B) In the case of a bid sought to be withdrawn, the bid
27 was submitted in good faith and the mistake was due to a calculation or
28 clerical error, an inadvertent omission, or a typographical error as opposed
29 to an error in judgment.
30 (3)(A) To receive relief under subdivision (e)(1) of this
31 section, the bidder must serve written notice to the secretary or to the
32 chief executive officer or his or her designee of a public institution of
33 higher education exempt from review and approval of the division any time
34 after the bid opening, but no later than seventy-two (72) hours after
35 receiving the intent to award, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
36 (B) Failure to make a withdrawal request within seventy-

As Engrossed: H2/20/25 S3/4/25 HB1508
1 two (72) hours shall constitute a waiver by the bidder of the bidder's right
2 to claim that the mistake in his or her bid was a scrivener's error.
3 (4) If the secretary or the chief executive officer or his or
4 her designee of a public institution of higher education exempt from review
5 and approval of the division has relieved the bidder from responsibility
6 under his or her bond, action on the remaining bids should be considered as
7 though the withdrawn bid had not been received.

9 that a bidder or supplier:
10 (A) Hold membership in any professional or industry
11 associations, societies, trade groups, or similar organizations;

9 Subchapter 2 — Security for Deposits
10
11 19-5-201. Legislative intent and construction.
12 The law specifying what securities may be accepted as security for the
13 deposit of public funds of the State of Arkansas or any political subdivision
14 of the state is inadequate in that it is unduly restrictive on the types of
15 securities that may be accepted. The types of securities that may be accepted
16 as security for deposits of public funds is in need of being expanded, and
17 this subchapter is supplementary to and does not repeal any existing law that
18 specifies certain securities that may be accepted as security for deposit of
19 public funds. To that end, this subchapter is declared to be remedial and
20 shall be liberally construed.
21
22 19-5-202. Definition.

33 or exceed the amount of the deposit to be secured.

35 subdivision, school district, improvement district, or other issuer has

26 of the refunding bonds or if the bonds are redeemable before maturity and
27 have been duly called for payment.

28
29 Subchapter 4 — Registered Public Obligations Act of Arkansas
30
31 19-6-401. Title.
32 This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the “Registered
33 Public Obligations Act of Arkansas”.
34
35 19-6-402. Purpose.
36 (a) The Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., provides that
227 03-04-2025 10:49:39 JLL144

As Engrossed: H2/20/25 S3/4/25 HB1508
1 interest with respect to certain obligations may not be exempt from federal
2 income taxation unless the obligations are in registered form. It is
3 therefore a matter of state concern that public entities be authorized to
4 provide for the issuance of obligations in such form. It is a purpose of this
5 subchapter to empower all public entities to establish and maintain a system
6 pursuant to which obligations may be issued in registered form within the
7 meaning of the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.
8 § 1 et seq.
9 (b) Obligations have traditionally been issued in bearer rather than
10 in registered form, and a change from bearer to registered form may affect
11 the relationships, rights, and duties of issuers of and the persons that deal
12 with obligations and, by such effect, the costs of issuing obligations. Such
13 effects will impact the various issuers and varieties of obligations
14 differently depending upon their legal and financial characteristics, their
15 markets, and their adaptability to recent and prospective technological and
16 organizational developments. It is therefore a matter of state concern that
17 public entities be provided flexibility in the development of such systems
18 and control over system incidents so as to accommodate the different impacts.
19 It is a purpose of this subchapter to empower the establishment, maintenance,
20 and amendment, from time to time, of differing systems of registration of
21 obligations so as to accommodate the differing impacts upon issuers and
22 varieties of obligations. It is further a purpose of this subchapter to
23 authorize systems that will facilitate the prompt and accurate transfer of
24 registered public obligations and develop practices with regard to the
25 registration and transfer of registered public obligations.

31 (1) The United States Supreme Court, in the case of South
32 Carolina v. Baker, 485 U.S. 505 (1988), held that no barrier exists under the
33 United States Constitution to the imposition of federal income taxation on
34 interest received by holders of bonds of governmental units. Such an
35 exemption from federal income taxation has been a desirable feature of these
36 bonds, operating to reduce interest expense to governmental units and

3 the financing of public improvements and other projects and programs that
4 serve important public purposes by the issuance of bonds is essential for the
5 health, welfare, and economic well-being of the people of the State of
6 Arkansas;
7 (3) By the adoption of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 1
8 et seq., the United States Congress has substantially limited the purposes
9 for which bonds may be issued with interest exempt from federal income
10 taxation and imposed other restrictive provisions as a condition of the
11 exemption. Additionally, under the authority of South Carolina v. Baker, the
12 United States Congress may be expected to enact other laws and effect changes
13 in federal tax policy to eliminate or further reduce the exemption of
14 interest on bonds of governmental units from federal income taxation, with
15 the result that, to provide financing for public purposes, governmental units
16 may now find it in their best interests to issue bonds the interest on which
17 is not exempt from federal income taxation;
18 (4) Under the Arkansas Constitution and existing laws of this
19 state, governmental units have had, and continue to have, the power to issue
20 bonds without respect to whether the interest thereon is subject to federal
21 income taxation. However, many statutes applicable to governmental units lack
22 effective, modern procedures under which the structure of a taxable financing
23 may comply with current market practices, obtain the lowest effective
24 borrowing cost, or provide terms most suitable to the governmental unit, the
25 project, or the financing program; and
26 (5) The purposes sought to be achieved by this subchapter are to
27 provide governmental units with all means necessary to obtain financing for
28 public purposes under the changing circumstances related to future tax policy
29 of the federal government and to supplement and complement the provisions of
30 existing and future laws authorizing the issuance of bonds, to the end that
31 governmental units may provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the
32 people by the issuance of bonds under terms and conditions necessary under
33 the then-existing conditions.

27 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, or its successor's, funds, or
28 changes in state use of appropriations for programs combined into block
29 grants from the United States Government become necessary, or if new federal

13 Because of the many revenue laws of the state providing for the levying
14 and collecting of taxes, licenses, and fees for the support of state
15 government and its agencies and enacted by the General Assembly, it is
16 declared to be the policy of the General Assembly with respect to all such
17 revenues and other state income that is required by law to be deposited into
18 the State Treasury to provide for the handling and deposit of the funds in
19 the manner provided in the Revenue Classification Law, § 19-40-101 et seq.,
20 and in this subtitle in the following manner:
21 (1) To declare the objects and purposes for which the general
22 revenues as defined in the Revenue Classification Law, § 19-40-101 et seq.,
23 and other incomes individually and collectively are to be used. It is the
24 intent and purpose of this section and other provisions of this subtitle to
25 comply with the provisions of the Arkansas Constitution, including Arkansas
26 Constitution, Article 16, § 11;
27 (2) Because the constitutional and fiscal agencies of the state
28 and certain other defined agencies or programs, either individually or

30 institution, agency, or activity supported from revenues deposited into the
31 State Treasury, it is declared to be the policy of the General Assembly that
32 all taxes, licenses, and fees defined as general revenues and special
33 revenues under the Revenue Classification Law, § 19-40-101 et seq., shall
34 contribute to the support of the constitutional and fiscal agencies and other

2 contributing to the general revenues as defined in the Revenue Classification
3 Law, § 19-40-101 et seq., it is not the purpose of this subtitle to levy or
4 to change the amount or rate of such taxes, but to state the purpose for
5 which such general revenues are to be used. This subtitle shall not be
6 construed as amending any of the provisions of the law with respect to the
7 taxes defined to be general revenues except for the purpose of providing for
8 the distribution of them and defining the purposes for which these revenues
9 are raised and collected; and
10 (4) As to the special taxes, licenses, fees, and other revenues
11 contributing to the special revenues as provided in the Revenue
12 Classification Law, § 19-40-101 et seq., it is not the intent of the Revenue
13 Classification Law, § 19-40-101 et seq., or of this subtitle to levy or
14 change the amount or rate of such taxes nor to change the purposes for which
15 those special revenues are to be used as provided by law. This subtitle shall
16 not be construed as amending any of the provisions of the law with respect to
17 the special revenues as defined in this subtitle, except for the purpose of
18 providing for the distribution of them and providing that the purposes for
19 which such revenues are collected shall also include the services rendered to
20 the constitutional and fiscal agencies and other defined agencies in the
21 manner provided in the Revenue Classification Law, § 19-40-101 et seq., and
22 in this subtitle.

8 Services, the Division of Aging, Adult, and Behavioral Health Services of the
9 Department of Human Services, and the Division of Developmental Disabilities
10 Services for the purposes of repairing, renovating, equipping, acquiring, and
11 constructing department facilities with an annual maximum of five million
12 dollars ($5,000,000).
13 (B) The projects for which these transfers are authorized
14 shall be projects that:
15 (i) Were unanticipated during the preceding regular
16 session of the General Assembly; and
17 (ii) If not carried out in the interim period
18 between regular sessions of the General Assembly, would cause greater harm to
19 the facilities, clients, or programs of the department than if carried out
20 during the next regular session; and
21 (3) Other nongeneral revenue funds as may be available within
22 the department that can be used for the purposes of the fund.
23 (d)(1) At the request of the Secretary of the Department of Human
24 Services and upon certification of the availability of such funds, the Chief
25 Fiscal Officer of the State shall initiate the necessary transfer documents
26 to reflect the transfer on the books of record of the Treasurer of State, the

1 end of the fiscal year.
2 (f) Determining the amount of funds appropriated to a state agency is
3 the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by
4 delineating specific line items and by identifying the appropriation and
5 funding attached to that line item. The General Assembly has determined that
6 the department could be operated more efficiently if some flexibility is
7 given to the department. That flexibility is being accomplished by providing
8 transfer authority in subsection (d) of this section, and since the General
9 Assembly has granted the department broad powers under the transfer authority
10 concept, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly
11 maintain oversight of the utilization of the transfer authority by requiring
12 prior approval of the Legislative Council in the utilization of this transfer
13 authority. Therefore, the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council
14 is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by
15 the Legislative Council is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent
16 jurisdiction, this entire section is void.

1 available that could be transferred in lieu of the funds in the Catastrophic
2 Reserve Fund.
3 (3) Documentation under subdivision (e)(2) of this section shall
4 be submitted to the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee for

6 (4)(A) The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, after having

16 § 19-20-101 et seq., by this section cause the general revenues to exceed the
17 maximum allocations authorized in the Revenue Stabilization Law, § 19-20-101
18 et seq.
19 (f) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation and general
20 revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year is the prerogative of the

22 in the appropriation acts for a state agency and the general revenue
23 allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the
24 Revenue Stabilization Law, § 19-20-101 et seq. Further, the General Assembly
25 has determined that creating the Catastrophic Reserve Fund and establishing
26 the procedures for the transfer of funds to various funds and fund accounts
27 in the Revenue Stabilization Law, § 19-20-101 et seq., or to the Economic
28 Development Superprojects Project Fund, or both, provides for the efficient
29 and effective operation of state government if a revenue shortfall is
30 determined to exist. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the
31 General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the
32 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this section.
33 The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
34 Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of
35 approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled
36 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is

28
29 19-61-407. Experience requirement — Findings.
30 (a)(1) The General Assembly finds that:
31 (A) An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, and a
32 request for qualifications often require that bidders and offerors have a
33 certain amount of experience to qualify;
34 (B) These experience requirements often apply to the
35 business of the bidder or offeror rather than the key personnel of the bidder
36 or offeror;
602 03-04-2025 10:49:39 JLL144

As Engrossed: H2/20/25 S3/4/25 HB1508
1 (C) As a result, new businesses with highly qualified
2 personnel often do not qualify to compete for state contracts even though the
3 executives and employees of the business have the experience required; and
4 (D) It is in the best interests of the state to encourage
5 new businesses and to seek out the most qualified people to provide products
6 and services to the state.
7 (2) The General Assembly intends for this section to:
8 (A) Encourage entrepreneurship;
9 (B) Level the playing field for new businesses to compete
10 for business opportunities; and
11 (C) Enable new businesses with highly qualified personnel
12 to compete for state contracts.
13 (b) If an invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or a request
14 for qualifications under this subtitle requires a certain amount of
15 experience or a certain number of years in existence for the bidder or
16 offeror, the requirement shall be satisfied by either:
17 (1)(A) The amount of experience of the bidder or offeror.
18 (B) A bidder or offeror may use the combined experience of
19 its owners or senior executive staff to satisfy the requirement under
20 subdivision (b)(1)(A) of this section; or
21 (2) The combined amount of experience of the key personnel of
22 the bidder or offeror that will be responsible for satisfying the
23 requirements of the contract to be procured.
24 (c)(1) However, before the issuance of an invitation for bids, a
25 request for proposals, or a request for qualifications, the Office of State
26 Procurement or a procurement agency may determine in writing that the
27 combined experience of the key personnel of a bidder or offeror under
28 subdivision (b)(2) of this section would be insufficient to adequately
29 satisfy the requirements of the invitation for bids, request for proposals,
30 or request for qualifications.
31 (2) A written determination under subdivision (c)(1) of this
32 section shall include the following:
33 (A) A specific description of the products or services
34 that the Office of State Procurement or procurement agency seeks to procure;
35 and
36 (B) A detailed statement of the reasons the combined
603 03-04-2025 10:49:39 JLL144

11 19-61-409. Compliance.
12 (a) A contractor shall ensure, in cooperation with a state agency,

14 requirements of this subtitle, including without limitation the inclusion of
15 any mandatory language and the submission of the contract for any required
16 review.
17 (b) The signature of a contractor on a contract with a state agency
18 serves as an acknowledgement that the contractor is:
19 (1) Equally responsible with the state agency for adhering to
20 the requirements of this subtitle related to the content and review of the
21 contract; and
22 (2) Subject to the relevant ethical provisions of § 19-64-101 et
23 seq.

9 subject to a final business closure order shall not be awarded or maintain a
10 contract with a state agency unless the office provides notice under
11 subsection (d) of this section.
12 (d) Upon receipt of information that a contractor has resolved a
13 business closure, the office shall notify all state agencies, as soon as

9 private industries and which increase the costs of products manufactured by
10 private industries. This advantage which is enjoyed by many out-of-state
11 correctional institutions allows the out-of-state correctional institutions
12 to often receive contracts under the Arkansas Procurement Law, § 19-61-101 et
13 seq., bidding process when Arkansas private industries also submit bids, thus

25 bidder is underbid by more than five percent (5%), as provided in § 19-61-
26 515, by another representative of private industry located outside the State
27 of Arkansas or is underbid by more than fifteen percent (15%) by an out-of-
28 state correctional institution, the state contract shall be awarded to the

12 (2) Creates an equity interest or ownership position for the
13 state retirement system; and

18 (a) A partial equity ownership agreement is subject to review by
19 submission of the partial equity ownership agreement to the Office of State
20 Procurement and the Legislative Council under this section.

22 substantially different from a state contract for commodities, goods, and
23 services that are reviewed under the Arkansas Procurement Law, § 19-61-101 et
24 seq., or other contract that is reviewed under this subtitle, and since the
25 partial equity ownership agreement is utilizing retirement trust funds that
26 are not appropriated by the General Assembly, the partial equity ownership
27 agreement is not subject to:
28 (1) A limitation of the term or duration of the partial equity
29 ownership agreement; or
30 (2) An annual renewal clause.
31 (c) When submitting a partial equity ownership agreement for review,
32 the state retirement system shall provide information that includes without
33 limitation:
34 (1) The managing parties to the partial equity ownership

12 ownership agreement that the office or the Legislative Council may reasonably
13 require for an adequate review.
14
15 19-69-103. Imminent need to enter into partial equity ownership
16 agreement.
17 (a) In lieu of a review under § 19-69-102, a partial equity ownership
18 agreement that necessitates immediate formation shall be reviewed by the

20 (b)(1) The board of trustees of a state retirement system may enter
21 into a partial equity ownership agreement or substantially alter the terms of
22 an existing partial equity ownership agreement if the board of trustees
23 passes a resolution that:
24 (A) Determines an imminent need to immediately form or
25 enter into the partial equity ownership agreement;
26 (B) Deems it financially appropriate to immediately form
27 or enter into a partial equity ownership agreement; and
28 (C) Concludes that to forego the opportunity to promptly
29 implement the board of trustees' investment directives under the prudent
30 investor rule as set out in §§ 24-2-610 — 24-2-619 would be inconsistent with
31 the board of trustees' fiduciary duty of care to the retirants.
32 (2) The board of trustees of the state retirement system shall
33 provide the office and the Legislative Council with a copy of the resolution
34 under subsection (a) of this section within five (5) business days of the
35 passage of the resolution.
36 (c) For a partial equity ownership agreement reviewed under this

2 and the Legislative Council within thirty (30) days of the passage of the
3 resolution that discloses:
4 (1) The managing parties to the partial equity ownership
5 agreement;
6 (2) The state retirement system's interest and ownership in the
7 partial equity ownership agreement;
8 (3) The reason for the immediate formation or entry into a

13 (5) The anticipated date of implementation;
14 (6) The anticipated termination date of the partial equity
15 ownership agreement; and

14
15 19-70-102. Legislative findings.
16 The General Assembly finds that:
17 (1) An efficient transportation system is critical for
18 Arkansas's economy and the quality of life of the state's residents;
19 (2) Transportation projects are costly and the revenues
20 currently available for highways and local roads are inadequate to preserve
21 and maintain existing infrastructure and to provide funds for highway
22 improvements;
23 (3) The State Highway Commission has developed an alternative,
24 cost-effective, procurement procedure for transportation projects performed
25 by the commission and the Arkansas Department of Transportation;
26 (4) A construction manager-general contractor method allows the
27 commission to engage a construction manager:
28 (A) To assist during the design and development process of
29 the transportation project, including without limitation to provide input
30 concerning the transportation project's:
31 (i) Design;
32 (ii) Scheduling;
33 (iii) Pricing; and
34 (iv) Phasing; and
35 (B) Who may subsequently become the general contractor and
36 construct the transportation project if the parties agree on a guaranteed
687 03-04-2025 10:49:39 JLL144

As Engrossed: H2/20/25 S3/4/25 HB1508
1 maximum price; and
2 (5) The cost-effective benefits are achieved by shifting the
3 liability and risk for cost containment and transportation project scheduling
4 to the construction manager, which leads many states to call this method the
5 “construction manager at-risk method”.

23
24 20-76-901. Contract services — Advance payment.
25 (a) In order to provide effective purchased services to the needy
26 citizens of Arkansas, the Secretary of the Department of Human Services is
27 authorized to pay one-twelfth (1/12) of the total amount of a Title XX
28 contract to the service provider on the effective date of the contract. The
29 amount of the advance payment shall be adjusted out of the reimbursement
30 actually earned by the provider during the contract period.
31 (b) This section will be used only after the secretary has conducted a
32 study of the financial condition of the contracting agency to determine if an
33 advance payment is necessary. If the advance is necessary, the secretary
34 shall forward his or her request and the reasons therefor to the Chief Fiscal
35 Officer of the State for approval.
36 (c)(1) If the request is approved, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the
769 03-04-2025 10:49:39 JLL144

2 the Department of Human Services from the Budget Stabilization Trust Fund.

5 by the department and repaid to the fund by June 30 of that fiscal year.
6
7 20-76-902. Minimum program standards.
8 (a) In order to unify and consolidate standards for services of
9 clients under programs funded by Title XX Social Security funds, the
10 Secretary of the Department of Human Services shall establish, by July 1,
11 1980, minimum program standards for the services provided by all government
12 or private agencies under Title XX.
13 (b) In developing these standards, the secretary will consult with
14 such other agencies, organizations, or individuals as may be appropriate.
15 (c) These standards may be amended by the secretary from time to time,
16 provided that the terms of the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act, § 25-
17 15-201 et seq., are complied with.
18
19 20-76-903. Loan provision.
20 (a) It is found and determined that the continued operations of the
21 Title XX Services Program of the Department of Human Services, in accordance
22 with the approved annual operations plan, are, from time to time, seriously
23 impaired by either administrative oversights and delays by the United States
24 Office of Grants Management or by the processes of federal fiscal year
25 conversion. It is further found and determined that such delays in the proper
26 preparation and transmittal of federal grant award authorizations and letter
27 of credit instruments have created unnecessary hardships on the providers of
28 services and the needy citizens of this state. Therefore, upon certification
29 of the pending availability of federal funding by the Secretary of the
30 Department of Human Services, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State may grant
31 temporary advances, the maximum amount not to exceed five million dollars
32 ($5,000,000), from the Budget Stabilization Trust Fund to the appropriate
33 account of the Department of Human Services so affected by such delays.
34 (b) The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall recover within a
35 period of twenty (20) days such temporary advances upon receipt of the grant
36 award authorizations or letter of credit instruments.

2 20-76-904. Deduction of tax withholding for individual contract
3 providers.
4 (a) It is found and determined that certain rules and regulations of
5 the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service require
6 the deduction of Federal Insurance Contributions Act and federal income tax
7 withholding from persons providing services under individual purchase-of-
8 service contracts, who are in fact independent contractors, or employees of
9 the person receiving the service, and that there is presently no provision
10 for payment of Federal Insurance Contributions Act and federal income tax
11 withholding for these individuals. It is further found and determined that
12 the use of individual contracts is necessary to the operation of the Title
13 XIX and Title XX programs, particularly in the areas of day care and services
14 to the elderly. Therefore, whenever the regulations of the Social Security
15 Administration or the Internal Revenue Service require the deduction of
16 Federal Insurance Contributions Act or federal income tax withholding for an
17 individual providing services under a Title XX individual purchase-of-service
18 contract, the Department of Human Services may pay the necessary Federal
19 Insurance Contributions Act tax out of federal funds and state or local
20 donated matching funds and may collect the necessary Federal Insurance
21 Contributions Act and federal income tax withholding as agent for the client
22 receiving the services.
23 (b) Individuals for whom Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is
24 paid and Federal Insurance Contributions Act and federal income tax
25 withholding is deducted under this section shall not be considered as
26 employees of the state for the purposes of determining eligibility for
27 unemployment compensation or workers' compensation, for the purpose of state
28 income tax withholding, or for any other purposes.
29
30 20-76-905. Use of funds.
31 The Secretary of the Department of Human Services is authorized to use
32 funds earned through service fees, audit settlements, or federal program
33 settlements for operation of the Title XX service program. Any unanticipated
34 federal funding received under this provision will be handled in accordance
35 with the terms of the Miscellaneous Federal Grant Act, § 19-7-301 et seq.

3 accordance with rules established by the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State,
4 shall have the authority to transfer funds and appropriations from the
5 appropriate division of the Department of Human Services to the various
6 agencies of the department which receive allotments of Title XX funds. These
7 transfers shall be limited to the allotment of funds available to each agency
8 within the department.
9 (2)(A) In the event that funds and appropriations transferred
10 under this section are not fully utilized, they will be available for
11 transfer back to the appropriate division of the department for reallocation.
12 (B) It is further intended that if transfer of
13 appropriations among line items appropriated to the appropriate division of
14 the department becomes necessary for effective operation of the program,
15 these shall be made in accordance with rules established by the Chief Fiscal
16 Officer of the State. However, no such transfer will be used to increase
17 authorization for regular salaries.
18 (b) The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and the secretary shall
19 cooperate to establish such fund accounts for deposit and disbursement of
20 federal and local Title XX funds as are necessary for the orderly operation
21 of a Title XX services program. The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and the
22 secretary shall establish procedures for the transfers of funds necessary to
23 make reimbursement to providers or to agency fund accounts in payment for
24 eligible services. These procedures will include provision for use of state
25 matching funds where appropriated by law.
26
27 20-76-907. Transfer of retirement benefits.
28 Any employee who is now a member of any retirement system shall not
29 lose any retirement benefits accrued in the system by the reorganization of
30 the Title XX service program. An employee so affected shall have the option
31 of continuing as a member of the retirement system of which the employee is a
32 member at the time of transfer or to join the retirement system for which the
33 transfer makes the employee eligible. However, the affected employee shall

9 SECTION 375. DO NOT CODIFY. Technical revisions to Code of Arkansas
10 Rules.
11 The General Assembly finds that:
12 (1) As a result of the recodification of Title 19 and other
13 amendments to the Arkansas Code under this act, multiple statutory references
14 to Title 19 or other provisions of Arkansas law in the Code of Arkansas Rules
15 will be incorrect and require revision to reflect the changes implemented by
16 this act; and
17 (2) It is the intent of the General Assembly that these
18 provisions of the Code of Arkansas Rules be updated by the Bureau of
19 Legislative Research as part of its maintenance of the Code of Arkansas

28
29 SECTION 376. DO NOT CODIFY. Correction of technical errors related to
30 implementation of recodification of Arkansas Code, Title 19.
31 (a)(1) The General Assembly finds that:
32 (A) The implementation of this act involves a multitude of
33 changes to existing Arkansas law;
34 (B) Many of the changes implemented by this act are highly
35 technical and require careful study of the purpose and context of each
36 Arkansas Code section, with the need for some of the changes not becoming
844 03-04-2025 10:49:39 JLL144

As Engrossed: H2/20/25 S3/4/25 HB1508
1 apparent until after the implementation of this act;
2 (C) When implementing revisions as large and comprehensive
3 as the changes under this act, it is inevitable that certain sections of the
4 Arkansas Code requiring technical changes to follow the intent of this act
5 will be either omitted or amended in a manner that is later found to be
6 erroneous and unintentional;
7 (D) It is likewise inevitable that other acts enacted by
8 the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly will not take into account the changes in
9 this act, resulting in technical inconsistencies between newly passed laws;
10 and
11 (E) If the correct statutory change to remedy an
12 unintentional error or an inconsistency between this act and another act of
13 the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly is readily apparent and consistent with the
14 intent of this act, the unintentional error or inconsistency should be
15 corrected as part of the codification process due to the technical nature of
16 the unintentional error or inconsistency.
17 (2) It is the intent of the General Assembly to empower the
18 Arkansas Code Revision Commission to correct technical errors identified in
19 the Arkansas Code during the implementation of this act to allow this act to
20 be fully implemented.
21 (b)(1)(A) Any person or state entity identifying one (1) or more
22 sections of the Arkansas Code that require revision to implement the intent
23 of this act may notify the Director of the Bureau of Legislative Research or
24 his or her designee of the section or sections at issue.
25 (B) If the Bureau of Legislative Research, while assisting
26 the commission with the commission's powers and duties, becomes aware of one
27 (1) or more sections of the Arkansas Code that require revision to implement
28 the intent of this act for which it appears that the bureau and the
29 commission do not have authority to make the necessary revision under § 1-2-
30 303(d), the bureau may notify the commission of the section or sections at
31 issue.
32 (2) If the commission determines that the revision necessary to
33 one (1) or more sections of the Arkansas Code under subdivision (b)(1) of
34 this section is technical in nature, germane to the intent of this act, and
