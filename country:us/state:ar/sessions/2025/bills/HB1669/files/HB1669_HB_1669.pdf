28
29 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Title.
30 This act shall be known and may be cited as the "Keep Kids First Act".
31
32 SECTION 2. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings.
33 (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that:
34 (1) The State of Arkansas seeks to place children in a safe,
35 loving, and supportive home when it must place a child with an adoptive or
36 foster family;
*LJH073*

As Engrossed: S3/20/25 HB1669
1 (2) The adoption and foster care agencies of the State of
2 Arkansas represent diverse organizations and groups, some of which are faith-
3 based and some of which are not faith-based, and faith-based organizations
4 and groups have a lengthy and distinguished history of providing adoption and
5 foster care services in the State of Arkansas;
6 (3) The United States Supreme Court has recognized the benefits
7 of having more, not fewer, adoption and foster care providers, stating that
8 "[m]aximizing the number of foster families and minimizing liability are
9 important goals, but the City fails to show that granting CSS an exception
10 will put those goals at risk. If anything, including CSS in the program
11 seems likely to increase, not reduce, the number of available foster
12 parents." Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 593 U.S. 522, 541—42;
13 (4)(A) Private child placement agencies and individuals,
14 including faith-based child placement agencies and individuals, have the
15 right to the free exercise of religion under both the Arkansas Constitution
16 and the United States Constitution.
17 (B) Under well-settled principles of constitutional law,
18 free exercise of religion includes the freedom to abstain from conduct that
19 conflicts with child placement agencies' sincerely held religious beliefs;
20 and
21 (5) Ensuring that faith-based child placement agencies can
22 continue to provide adoption and foster care services will benefit the
23 children and families who receive those services.
24 (b) Therefore, the General Assembly declares that the Keep Kids First
25 Act is necessary to ensure that faith-based adoption and foster care
26 providers remain free to serve children in need and work with the State of
27 Arkansas to find loving, forever homes for children.

17 sincerely held religious or moral beliefs.
18 (2)(A) The state government shall not take any discriminatory
19 action against a person whom the state government places custody of a foster

28 placement of the child in order to prioritize placement of the child with a
29 person of the same religious background or, if a person with the same or

6 liability, other adverse administrative action, or any claim or cause of
7 action under any state or local law.
8 (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an action under
9 this section may be commenced, and relief may be granted, without regard to
