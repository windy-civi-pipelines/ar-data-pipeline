19 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
20 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
21 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
22 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
23 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
24 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
25 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
