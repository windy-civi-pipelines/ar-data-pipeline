3 SECTION 5. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
4 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
5 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
6 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
7 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
8 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
9 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
10 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
11 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
12 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
13 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
