General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that beds in psychiatric
residential treatment facilities have been permitted but are not currently
licensed; that these beds in psychiatric residential treatment facilities
that are not licensed cannot be used for children in need of healthcare
services despite the demand for the beds; that this act would authorize
licensing of the beds in psychiatric residential treatment facilities and
JMB595 - 03-26-2025 10:20:02 Amendment No. 2 to House Bill 1653 Page 14 of 15

therefore allow the use of these beds in psychiatric residential treatment
facilities for children in need; and that this act is immediately necessary
to provide healthcare services to children in need across this state who are
currently not able to be admitted into a psychiatric residential treatment
facility. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and
safety shall become effective on:
(1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
(2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
bill; or
(3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto."
