27
28 23-18-1302. Legislative findings and intent.
29 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
30 (1) Arkansas's wind energy resources are an important asset for
31 the:
32 (A) Continued economic growth of Arkansas; and
33 (B) Provision of clean and renewable power to the people
34 of Arkansas and the nation as a whole;
35 (2) Promotion of the development of wind energy resources is
36 important to the economic growth of Arkansas;
*ANS527*

SB639
1 (3) The conversion of wind energy into power for utility-scale
2 systems frequently requires large wind energy systems consisting of wind
3 turbines, electrical substations, electrical lines, and other supporting
4 systems;
5 (4) The construction, location, and operation of wind energy
6 facilities can have significant potential impacts on the health, safety, and
7 welfare of the members of the communities in which the wind energy facilities
8 are constructed;
9 (5) It is essential to the public interest to minimize any
10 adverse effect upon the environment and the quality of life of the people of
11 Arkansas that wind energy facilities might cause;
12 (6) The prudent development of wind energy resources requires
13 addressing balancing the needs of wind energy facility developers with those
14 of landowners that provide access to the wind energy resource, including
15 assurances that:
16 (A) Wind energy facilities will be properly constructed
17 and decommissioned; and
18 (B) The landowners will:
19 (i) Have access to adequate information to verify
20 the accuracy of any payments made by wind energy facilities; and
21 (ii) Be adequately protected against hazards and
22 accidents that may arise from the wind energy facilities;
23 (7) A wind energy facility, if abandoned or not properly
24 constructed and maintained, could pose a hazard to the public health, safety,
25 and welfare of the people of this state through mechanical failures,
26 electrical hazards, or the release of hazardous substances;
27 (8) In order to protect the public against health and safety
28 hazards, standards for the safe decommissioning of wind energy facilities
29 should be established, and assurance of adequate financial resources should
30 be given so that a wind energy facility can be properly decommissioned at the
31 end of the wind energy facility's useful life; and
32 (9) A local legislative body should have an opportunity to adopt
33 local legislation addressing the construction of wind energy facilities
34 located in its jurisdiction if the local legislation is consistent with this
35 subchapter and existing federal and state law and does not establish criteria
36 for the issuance of a local permit that are less restrictive than stated

SB639
1 under this subchapter.
2 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that this subchapter
3 shall:
4 (1) Establish the standards and criteria for permitting and
5 regulating wind energy facilities; and
6 (2) Promote, preserve, and protect the public peace, health,
7 safety, and welfare through effective permitting and regulation of wind
8 energy facilities.

14 TO CREATE THE ARKANSAS WIND ENERGY
15 DEVELOPMENT ACT.
16
17 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
18
19 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code Title 23, Chapter 18, is amended to add an
20 additional subchapter to read as follows:
21
22 Subchapter 13 — Arkansas Wind Energy Development Act
23
24 23-18-1301. Title.
25 This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Arkansas Wind
26 Energy Development Act".
27
28 23-18-1302. Legislative findings and intent.
29 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
30 (1) Arkansas's wind energy resources are an important asset for
31 the:
32 (A) Continued economic growth of Arkansas; and
33 (B) Provision of clean and renewable power to the people
34 of Arkansas and the nation as a whole;
35 (2) Promotion of the development of wind energy resources is
36 important to the economic growth of Arkansas;
*ANS527*
04/09/2025 6:34:24 PM ANS527

SB639
1 (3) The conversion of wind energy into power for utility-scale
2 systems frequently requires large wind energy systems consisting of wind
3 turbines, electrical substations, electrical lines, and other supporting
4 systems;
5 (4) The construction, location, and operation of wind energy
6 facilities can have significant potential impacts on the health, safety, and
7 welfare of the members of the communities in which the wind energy facilities
8 are constructed;
9 (5) It is essential to the public interest to minimize any
10 adverse effect upon the environment and the quality of life of the people of
11 Arkansas that wind energy facilities might cause;
12 (6) The prudent development of wind energy resources requires
13 addressing balancing the needs of wind energy facility developers with those
14 of landowners that provide access to the wind energy resource, including
15 assurances that:
16 (A) Wind energy facilities will be properly constructed
17 and decommissioned; and
18 (B) The landowners will:
19 (i) Have access to adequate information to verify
20 the accuracy of any payments made by wind energy facilities; and
21 (ii) Be adequately protected against hazards and
22 accidents that may arise from the wind energy facilities;
23 (7) A wind energy facility, if abandoned or not properly
24 constructed and maintained, could pose a hazard to the public health, safety,
25 and welfare of the people of this state through mechanical failures,
26 electrical hazards, or the release of hazardous substances;
27 (8) In order to protect the public against health and safety
28 hazards, standards for the safe decommissioning of wind energy facilities
29 should be established, and assurance of adequate financial resources should
30 be given so that a wind energy facility can be properly decommissioned at the
31 end of the wind energy facility's useful life; and
32 (9) A local legislative body should have an opportunity to adopt
33 local legislation addressing the construction of wind energy facilities
34 located in its jurisdiction if the local legislation is consistent with this
35 subchapter and existing federal and state law and does not establish criteria
36 for the issuance of a local permit that are less restrictive than stated

SB639
1 under this subchapter.
2 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that this subchapter
3 shall:
4 (1) Establish the standards and criteria for permitting and
5 regulating wind energy facilities; and
6 (2) Promote, preserve, and protect the public peace, health,
7 safety, and welfare through effective permitting and regulation of wind
8 energy facilities.
