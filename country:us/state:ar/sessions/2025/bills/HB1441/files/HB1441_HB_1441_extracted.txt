1 are used to describe any tract of land which in the same document is also
2 described by reference to any subdivision, line, or other corner of the
3 United States Public Land Survey, the description by the coordinates shall be
4 construed as supplemental to the basic description of such subdivision, line,
5 or corner contained in the official plats and field notes filed of record,
6 and in the event of any conflict, the description by reference to the
7 subdivision, line, or corner of the United States Public Land Survey shall
8 prevail over the description by coordinates.

34 15-21-309. Description by coordinates supplemental to references to
35 public land surveys.
36 Wherever coordinates based on the Arkansas Plane Coordinate System 1983

1 are used to describe any tract of land which in the same document is also
2 described by reference to any subdivision, line, or other corner of the
3 United States Public Land Survey, the description by the coordinates shall be
4 construed as supplemental to the basic description of such subdivision, line,
5 or corner contained in the official plats and field notes filed of record,
6 and in the event of any conflict, the description by reference to the
7 subdivision, line, or corner of the United States Public Land Survey shall
8 prevail over the description by coordinates.

10 15-21-310. Reliance on system not required.
11 Nothing contained in this subchapter shall require any purchaser or
12 mortgagee to rely on the description, any part of which depends exclusively
13 upon the Arkansas Plane Coordinate System 1983.

15 SECTION 9. Arkansas Code Title 15, Chapter 21, Subchapter 3, is
16 amended to add an additional section to read as follows:
17 15-21-311. Superseded legacy Arkansas plane coordinate systems.
18 (a)(1) Two (2) plane coordinate systems were previously defined in
19 statute:
20 (A) The most recent based on the North American Datum of
21 1983; and
22 (B) The prior version based on the North American Datum of
23 1927.
24 (2) Both of the plane coordinate systems referenced in
25 subdivision (a)(1) of this section are superseded by the Arkansas Plane
26 Coordinate System under § 15-21-301.
27 (3) If either of the legacy systems referenced in subdivision
28 (a)(1) of this section are used, the legacy system shall be referred to as
29 either of the following to clearly distinguish the legacy systems from each
30 other and the Arkansas Plane Coordinate System:
31 (A) Arkansas Coordinate System 1983; or
32 (B) Arkansas Coordinate System 1927.
33 (b)(1) For both the Arkansas Coordinate System 1983 and the Arkansas
34 Coordinate System 1927, if a coordinate value is expressed in feet, the
35 United States survey foot shall be used.
36 (2) To calculate the United States survey foot required under

As Engrossed: H2/13/25 HB1441
1 subdivision (b)(1) of this section, one (1) foot equals 1200/3937 meters
2 exactly.
3 (c)(1)(A) Both the Arkansas Coordinate System 1983 and the Arkansas
4 Coordinate System 1927 are divided into a north and south zone.
5 (B) The north zone is assigned code 0301, and the south
6 zone is assigned code 0302.
7 (2) The zones in both systems are Lambert conformal conic map
8 projections.
9 (d)(1)(A) Both the Arkansas Coordinate System 1983 and the Arkansas
10 Coordinate System 1927 north zone have standard parallels at north latitudes
11 of thirty-four degrees fifty-six minutes (34° 56′ north) and thirty-six
12 degrees fourteen minutes (36° 14′ north), along which parallels the scale is
13 exact.
14 (B) The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of
15 the meridian ninety-two degrees zero minutes west of Greenwich (92° 00′ west)
16 and the parallel thirty-four degrees twenty minutes north latitude (34° 20′
17 north).
18 (C) For the Arkansas Coordinate System 1983, this origin
19 is given the coordinates of east equals four hundred thousand meters (400,000
20 m.) and north equals zero meters (0.0 m.).
21 (D) For the Arkansas Coordinate System 1927, this origin
22 is given the coordinates x equals two million United States survey feet
23 (2,000,000′) and y equals zero (0′) United States survey feet.
24 (2)(A) Both the Arkansas Coordinate System 1983 and the Arkansas
25 Coordinate System 1927 south zone have standard parallels at north latitudes
26 of thirty-three degrees eighteen minutes (33° 18′ north) and thirty-four
27 degrees forty minutes (34° 46′ north), along which parallels the scale shall
28 be exact.
29 (B) The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of
30 the meridian ninety-two degrees zero minutes west of Greenwich (92° 0′ west)
31 and the parallel thirty-two degrees forty minutes north latitude (32° 40′
32 north).
33 (C) For the Arkansas Coordinate System 1983, the origin is
34 given the coordinates of east equals four hundred thousand meters (400,000
35 m.), and north equals four hundred thousand meters (400,000 m.).
36 (D) For the Arkansas Coordinate System 1927, the origin is
6 02-13-2025 10:31:31 CRH111

As Engrossed: H2/13/25 HB1441
1 given the coordinates x equals two million United States survey feet
2 (2,000,000′), and y equals zero (0′) United States survey feet.
3 (e) The Arkansas Coordinate System of 1983 north zone consists of the
4 following counties listed from west to east, and all counties to the north:
5 (1) Scott County;
6 (2) Yell County;
7 (3) Perry County;
8 (4) Pulaski County;
9 (5) Faulkner County;
10 (6) White County;
11 (7) Woodruff County;
12 (8) St. Francis County; and
13 (9) Crittenden County.
14 (f) The Arkansas Coordinate System of 1983 south zone consists of the
15 following counties listed from west to east, and all counties to the south:
16 (1) Polk County;
17 (2) Montgomery County;
18 (3) Garland County;
19 (4) Saline County;
20 (5) Grant County;
21 (6) Jefferson County;
22 (7) Lonoke County;
23 (8) Prairie County;
24 (9) Monroe County; and
25 (10) Lee County.
26 (g) The Arkansas Coordinate System of 1927 north zone and south zone
27 consist of the same counties as the Arkansas Coordinate System of 1983
28 provided in subsections (e) and (f) of this section, except that Pulaski
29 County is in the south zone rather than the north zone.
