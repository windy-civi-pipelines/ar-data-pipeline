28 actuarial requirements; that the revisions and updates are of great
29 importance to members of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and to other

33 to begin on the first day of the fiscal year and to allow for a structured
34 and proper administration of the procedures referenced in this act; that the
35 updates and revisions to the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System Act are of
