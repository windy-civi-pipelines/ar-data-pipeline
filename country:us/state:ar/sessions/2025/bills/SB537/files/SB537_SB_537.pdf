17 (1) The supervised offender shall provide supporting

20 his or her community supervision officer;
21 (2)(A) The community supervision officer shall verify the
22 supervised offender’s eligible employment through the supervised offender’s
23 supporting documentation and any other means that the division determines
24 necessary.
25 (B) The community supervision officer shall enter the
26 supporting documentation into and record the supervised offender’s accrual of

28 working days of verifying the supervised offender’s eligible employment;

19 SECTION 4. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
20 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that recidivism threatens the
21 safety of the state; that incentivizing a person on probation, parole, and
22 post-release supervision will reduce the risk of recidivism; and that this
23 act is immediately necessary to reduce the risk of recidivism and provide for
24 the efficient and effective allocation of supervision services. Therefore, an
25 emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for
26 the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become
27 effective on:
28 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
29 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
30 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
31 bill; or
32 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
33 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
