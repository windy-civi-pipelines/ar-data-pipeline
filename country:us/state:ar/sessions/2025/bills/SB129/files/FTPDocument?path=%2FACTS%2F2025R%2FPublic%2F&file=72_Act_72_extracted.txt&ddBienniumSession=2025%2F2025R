9 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
10 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
11 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
12 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
13 Procedures and Restrictions Act, the Higher Education Expenditure Restriction
14 Act, or their successors, and other fiscal control laws of this State, where
15 applicable, and regulations promulgated by the Department of Finance and
16 Administration, as authorized by law, shall be strictly complied with in
17 disbursement of said funds.
18
19 SECTION 13. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
20 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
21 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
22 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
23 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
24 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
25 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
26 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
27
28 SECTION 14. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
29 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
30 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
31 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
32 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
33 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
34 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
35 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
36 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
19 01/27/2025 1:30:04 PM HAR032
SB129
1 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
2 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.

28 SECTION 14. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
29 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
30 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
31 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
32 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
33 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
34 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
35 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
36 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
19 01/27/2025 1:30:04 PM HAR032

SB129
1 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
