HB1361
1 (B) Benefits otherwise payable under plan coverage shall
2 be reduced by all amounts paid or payable through any other health insurance
3 or any other source providing benefits because of a sickness or injury and by
4 all hospital and medical expense benefits paid or payable under any workers'
5 compensation coverage, automobile medical payment, or liability insurance
6 whether provided on the basis of fault or nonfault and by any hospital or
7 medical benefits paid or payable under or provided pursuant to any state or
8 federal law or program.
9 (2) The pool shall have a cause of action against a covered
10 person for the recovery of the amount of benefits paid that are not covered
11 by the pool. Benefits due from the pool may be reduced or refused as a set-
12 off against any amount recoverable under this subdivision (d)(2).
13 (e) Right of Subrogation — Recoveries.
14 (1)(A) Whenever the pool has paid benefits because of sickness
15 or an injury to any covered person resulting from a third party's wrongful
16 act or negligence or for which an insurance company or self-insured entity is
17 liable in accordance with the provisions of any policy of insurance, and the
18 covered person has recovered or may recover damages from a third party that
19 is liable for damages, the pool shall have the right to recover the benefits
20 it paid from any amounts that the covered person has received or may receive
21 regardless of the date of the sickness or injury or the date of any
22 settlement, judgment, or award resulting from the sickness or injury.
23 (B) The pool shall be subrogated to any right of recovery
24 the covered person may have under the terms of any private or public
25 healthcare coverage or liability coverage including coverage under a workers'
26 compensation act without the necessity of assignment of claim or other
27 authorization to secure the right of recovery.
28 (C) To enforce its subrogation right, the pool may:
29 (i) Intervene or join in an action or proceeding
30 brought by the covered person or his or her personal representative,
31 including his or her guardian, conservator, estate, dependents, or survivors,
32 against any third party or the third party's insurance carrier or self-
33 insured entity that may be liable; or
34 (ii) Institute and prosecute legal proceedings
35 against any third party or the third party's insurance carrier or self-
36 insured entity that may be liable for the sickness or injury in an

HB1361
1 appropriate court either in the name of the pool or in the name of the
2 covered person or his or her personal representative including his or her
3 guardian, conservator, estate, dependents, or survivors.
4 (2)(A)(i) If any action or claim is brought by or on behalf of a
5 covered person against a third party or the third party's insurance carrier
6 or self-insured entity, the covered person or his or her personal
7 representative, including his or her guardian, conservator, estate,
8 dependents, or survivors, shall notify the pool by personal service or
9 registered mail of the action or claim and of the name of the court in which
10 the action or claim is brought, filing proof thereof in the action or claim.
11 (ii) The pool may, at any time thereafter, join in
12 the action or claim upon its motion so that all orders of court after hearing
13 and judgment shall be made for its protection.
14 (B) No release or settlement of a claim for damages and no
15 satisfaction of judgment in the action shall be valid without the written
16 consent of the pool to the extent of its interest in the settlement or
17 judgment and of the covered person or his or her personal representative.
18 (3)(A) In the event that the covered person or his or her
19 personal representative fails to institute a proceeding against any
20 appropriate third party before the fifth month before the action would be
21 barred, the pool, in its own name or in the name of the covered person or
22 personal representative, may commence a proceeding against any appropriate
23 third party for the recovery of damages on account of any sickness, injury,
24 or death to the covered person.
25 (B) The covered person shall cooperate in doing what is
26 reasonably necessary to assist the pool in any recovery and shall not take
27 any action that would prejudice the pool's right to recovery.
28 (C) The pool shall pay to the covered person or his or her
29 personal representative all sums collected from any third party by judgment
30 or otherwise in excess of amounts paid in benefits under the pool and amounts
31 paid or to be paid as costs, attorney's fees, and reasonable expenses
32 incurred by the pool in making the collection or enforcing the judgment.
33 (4)(A)(i) In the event of judgment or award in either a suit or
34 claim against a third party, the court shall first order paid from any
35 judgment or award the reasonable litigation expenses incurred in preparation
36 and prosecution of the action or claim, together with reasonable attorney's
28 01/31/2025 10:34:07 AM ANS002

HB1361
1 fees.
2 (ii) After payment of those expenses and attorney's
3 fees, the court shall apply out of the balance of the judgment or award an
4 amount sufficient to reimburse the pool the full amount of benefits paid on
5 behalf of the covered person under this subchapter, provided that the court
6 may reduce and apportion the pool's portion of the judgment proportionately
7 to the recovery of the covered person.
8 (B)(i) The burden of producing sufficient evidence to
9 support the exercise by the court of its discretion to reduce the amount of a
10 proven charge sought to be enforced against the recovery shall rest with the
11 party seeking the reduction.
12 (ii) The court may consider the nature and extent of
13 the injury, economic and noneconomic loss, settlement offers, comparative or
14 contributory negligence as it applies to the case at hand, hospital costs,
15 physician costs, and all other appropriate costs.
16 (C) The pool shall pay its pro rata share of the
17 attorney's fees based on the pool's recovery as it compares to the total
18 judgment.
19 (D) Any reimbursement rights of the pool shall take
20 priority over all other liens and charges existing under the laws of the
21 State of Arkansas.
22 (5) The pool may compromise or settle and release any claim for
23 benefits provided under this subchapter or waive any claims for benefits, in
24 whole or in part, for the convenience of the pool or if the pool determines
25 that collection will result in undue hardship upon the covered person.
26 (f) Preexisting Conditions.
27 (1) Except for federally eligible individuals or qualified trade
28 adjustment assistance eligible persons qualifying for plan coverage under §
29 23-79-509(b) or resident eligible persons or trade adjustment assistance
30 eligible persons who qualify for and elect to purchase the waiver authorized
31 in subdivision (f)(2) of this section, plan coverage shall exclude charges or
32 expenses incurred during the first six (6) months following the effective
33 date of coverage as to any condition if:
34 (A) The condition has manifested itself within the six-
35 month period immediately preceding the effective date of coverage in such a
36 manner as would cause an ordinary prudent person to seek diagnosis, care, or
29 01/31/2025 10:34:07 AM ANS002

HB1361
1 treatment; or
2 (B) Medical advice, care, or treatment was recommended or
3 received within the six-month period immediately preceding the effective date
4 of the coverage.
5 (2) Waiver. The preexisting condition exclusions as set forth
6 in subdivision (f)(1) of this section will be waived to the extent to which
7 the resident eligible person or trade adjustment assistance eligible person:
8 (A) Has satisfied similar exclusions under any prior
9 individual health insurance coverage that was involuntarily terminated; and
10 (B)(i) Has applied for plan coverage not later than thirty
11 (30) days following the involuntary termination.
12 (ii) For each resident eligible person or trade
13 adjustment assistance eligible person who qualifies for and elects this
14 waiver, there shall be added on a prorated basis to each payment of premium a
15 surcharge of up to ten percent (10%) of the otherwise applicable annual
16 premium for as long as that individual's coverage under the plan remains in
17 effect or sixty (60) months, whichever is less.
18 (3)(A) Whenever benefits are due from the plan because of
19 sickness or an injury to a covered person resulting from a third party's
20 wrongful act or negligence and the covered person has recovered or may
21 recover damages from a third party or its insurance carrier or self-insured
22 entity, the plan shall have the right to reduce benefits or to refuse to pay
23 benefits that otherwise may be payable in the amount of damages that the
24 covered person has recovered or may recover regardless of the date of the
25 sickness or injury or the date of any settlement, judgment, or award
26 resulting from that sickness or injury.
27 (B)(i) During the pendency of any action or claim that is
28 brought by or on behalf of a covered person against a third party or its
29 insurance carrier or self-insured entity, any benefits that would otherwise
30 be payable except for the provisions of this subsection shall be paid if
31 payment by or for the third party has not yet been made and the covered
32 person or, if capable, that person's legal representative agrees in writing
33 to pay back properly the benefits paid as a result of the sickness or injury
34 to the extent of any future payments made by or for the third party for the
35 sickness or injury.
36 (ii) This agreement is to apply whether or not
30 01/31/2025 10:34:07 AM ANS002

HB1361
1 liability for the payments is established or admitted by the third party or
2 whether those payments are itemized.
3 (C) Any amounts due the plan to repay benefits may be
4 deducted from other benefits payable by the plan after payments by or for the
5 third party are made.
6 (4) Benefits due from the plan may be reduced or refused as an
7 offset against any amount otherwise recoverable under this section.
8
9 23-79-511. Confidentiality.
10 (a)(1) All steps necessary under state and federal law to protect
11 confidentiality of applicants and covered persons shall be undertaken by the
12 Board of Directors of the Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool to
13 prevent the identification of individual records of covered persons under the
14 plan, rejected by the plan, or who may become ineligible for further
15 participation in the plan.
16 (2) Procedures shall be written by the board to assure the
17 confidentiality of records of persons covered under, rejected by, or who
18 became ineligible for further participation in the plan when gathering and
19 submitting data to the board or any other entity.
20 (b) Any information submitted to the board by hospitals or any other
21 provider pursuant to this subchapter from which the identity of a particular
22 individual can be determined shall be privileged and confidential and shall
23 not be disclosed in any manner. The foregoing includes, but shall not be
24 limited to, disclosure, inspection, or copying under the Freedom of
25 Information Act of 1967, § 25-19-101 et seq.
26
27 23-79-512. Collective action.
28 Neither the participation in the plan as insurers, the establishment of
29 rates, forms, or procedures nor any other joint or collective action required
30 by this subchapter shall be the basis of any legal action, criminal or civil
31 liability, or penalty against the plan or any insurer.
32
33 23-79-513. Unfair referral to plan — Prohibited practices by
34 employers.
35 (a) It shall constitute an unfair trade practice under the Trade
36 Practices Act, § 23-66-201 et seq., for an insurer, agent, broker, or third-
31 01/31/2025 10:34:07 AM ANS002

HB1361
1 party administrator to refer an individual to the Arkansas Comprehensive
2 Health Insurance Pool or arrange for an individual to apply to the pool for
3 the purpose of:
4 (1) Separating the individual from group health insurance
5 coverage provided by a group health plan; or
6 (2) Facilitating enrollment in the pool by any of the following
7 individuals associated with an employer, with the knowledge that the employer
8 intends to pay or is paying all or part of the premium payments owed by the
9 individual for pool coverage:
10 (A) An employee of the employer;
11 (B) A retired employee of the employer; or
12 (C) A dependent of an employee or retired employee of the
13 employer.
14 (b) Because pool coverage is not intended to cover participants who
15 are eligible for a group health plan, an individual described in subdivision
16 (a)(2) of this section is not eligible:
17 (1) For pool coverage if the employer associated with the
18 applicant intends to pay for all or part of the pool premium payments for the
19 individual; or
20 (2) To continue pool coverage if the employer associated with
21 the individual directly or indirectly pays all or part of the pool premium
22 payments for the individual.
23
24 23-79-515. Orderly cessation of operations.
25 (a)(1) The Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool shall cease
26 enrollment and coverage under the plan on and after January 1, 2014, as
27 required by federal law.
28 (2) After taking all reasonable steps, including those specified
29 in this section, to timely and efficiently assist in the transition of
30 individuals receiving plan coverage to the individual health insurance
31 market, the Board of Directors of the Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance
32 Pool shall cease operating the pool after paying health insurance claims for
33 plan coverage and meeting all other obligations of the board under this
34 section.
35 (b) The board may take all actions it deems necessary to:
36 (1) Cease enrollment for plan coverage effective December 1,
32 01/31/2025 10:34:07 AM ANS002

HB1361
1 2013;
2 (2)(A) Terminate all existing plan coverage effective at the end
3 of the calendar day on December 31, 2013.
4 (B) The board shall provide at least ninety (90) days
5 notice to current policyholders of the termination; and
6 (3) Amend plan policies and provide adequate notice to
7 policyholders, agents, and providers that to be paid or reimbursed, a claim
8 for plan services is required to be filed by the earlier of one hundred
9 eighty (180) days after plan coverage ends or three hundred sixty-five (365)
10 days after the date of service giving rise to the claim.
11 (c) This section does not require the board to revise plan benefits to
12 comply with federal law or to maintain plan coverage for any individual after
13 December 31, 2013.
14 (d)(1) After all plan coverage terminates under this section, the
15 board shall take reasonable steps to wind up all significant operations of
16 the pool by December 31, 2014.
17 (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, to
18 facilitate an efficient cessation of operations:
19 (A) The board may continue to use existing contractors
20 until cessation of operations without the need to issue competitive requests
21 for proposals;
22 (B) The board may continue to fund operations of this
23 subchapter under § 23-79-507;
24 (C) The board shall remain in effect:
25 (i) As provided by § 23-79-504(b); and
26 (ii) Until a judgment, order, or decree in any
27 action, suit, or proceeding commenced against or by the pool is fully
28 executed; and
29 (D)(i) The term of each current board member shall be
30 extended until the date the pool concludes all business as provided under
31 this section and the Insurance Commissioner certifies the cessations of
32 operations under subsection (g) of this section.
33 (ii) The term of a board member expires when the
34 commissioner certifies the cessations of operations under subsection (g) of
35 this section.
36 (e) On or before June 30, 2013, the board shall amend the plan of
33 01/31/2025 10:34:07 AM ANS002

HB1361
1 operation to reflect the actions necessary to implement this section.
2 (f) If the board has excess funds after the cessation of operations of
3 the pool, the funds shall be returned to the general revenue funds of the
4 state.
5 (g)(1) On or before March 1, 2016, or a later date if necessary to
6 complete the cessation of operations of the pool, the board shall file a
7 report with the General Assembly and commissioner that reflects completion of
8 the requirements of this section and includes an independent auditor's report
9 on the financial statements of the pool.
10 (2) If satisfied upon review of the report that the board has
11 complied with this section and accomplished the pool's cessation of
12 operations in a reasonable manner, the commissioner shall certify that the
13 business of the pool has concluded in accordance with this section and
14 publish the certification on the State Insurance Department website.
15 (h) Upon certification under subsection (g) of this section, the
16 operations of the pool are suspended indefinitely unless reactivated by the
17 General Assembly.
18 (i) The commissioner may address any matters regarding the pool
19 arising after the certification under subsection (g) of this section, and the
20 Attorney General shall defend a legal action filed after the certification,
21 including seeking the dismissal of the action under § 23-79-516 or for any
22 other purpose.
23 (j) Unless inconsistent with this section, the remainder of this
24 subchapter continues to apply to the pool and the board.
25
26 23-79-516. Statute of limitations and repose.
27 Because winding up the operations of the Arkansas Comprehensive Health
28 Insurance Pool requires the expeditious determination of its outstanding
29 liabilities, a cause of action against the pool or the Board of Directors of
30 the Arkansas Comprehensive Health Insurance Pool shall be commenced within
31 the earlier of one (1) year after the cause of action accrues or December 31,
32 2015.
33
34 23-79-517. Individuals moving to Arkansas and previously covered by
35 another qualified high-risk pool.
36 (a) Notwithstanding § 23-79-510(f), if a resident eligible person is
34 01/31/2025 10:34:07 AM ANS002

HB1361
1 eligible for plan coverage because the person previously was covered under a
2 qualified high-risk pool of another state, a preexisting condition exclusion
3 otherwise applicable to the resident eligible person:
4 (1) Shall be reduced by each month of coverage in which the
5 resident eligible person was subject to a preexisting condition exclusion in
6 the other state's qualified high-risk pool; or
7 (2) Does not apply if the resident eligible person was not
8 subject to a preexisting condition exclusion in the other state's qualified
9 high-risk pool.
10 (b) This section expires on the last day an individual may be enrolled
11 into plan coverage under this subchapter.
12
13 SECTION 8. DO NOT CODIFY. CONSTRUCTION AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
14 It is the intent of the General Assembly that:
15 (1) The enactment and adoption of this act shall not expressly
16 or impliedly repeal an act passed during the regular session of the Ninety-
17 Fifth General Assembly;
18 (2) To the extent that a conflict exists between an act of the
19 regular session of the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly and this act:
20 (A) The act of the regular session of the Ninety-Fifth
21 General Assembly shall be treated as a subsequent act passed by the General
22 Assembly for the purposes of:
23 (i) Giving the act of the regular session of the
24 Ninety-Fifth General Assembly its full force and effect; and
25 (ii) Amending or repealing the appropriate parts of
26 the Arkansas Code of 1987; and
27 (B) Section 1-2-107 shall not apply; and
28 (3) This act shall make only technical, not substantive, changes
29 to the Arkansas Code of 1987.
