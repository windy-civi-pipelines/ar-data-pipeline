29 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
30 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
31 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
32 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
33 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
