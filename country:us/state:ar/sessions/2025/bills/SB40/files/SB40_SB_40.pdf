6 SECTION 8. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
7 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
8 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
9 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
10 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
11 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
12 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
13 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
14 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
15
16 SECTION 9. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
17 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
18 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
19 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
20 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
21 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
22 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
23 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
24
25 SECTION 10. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
26 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
27 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
28 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
29 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
30 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
31 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
32 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
33 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
34 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
35 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
