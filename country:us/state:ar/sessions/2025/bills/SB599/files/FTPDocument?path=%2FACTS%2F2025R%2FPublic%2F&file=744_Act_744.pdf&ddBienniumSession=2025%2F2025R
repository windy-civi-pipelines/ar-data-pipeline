2 SECTION 5. Arkansas Code § 9-9-214(c), concerning the issuance of a
3 decree for adoption after the period of time for the withdrawal of consent
4 and relinquishment have passed and the adoption is in the best interest of
5 the individual to be adopted under the Revised Uniform Adoption Act, is
6 amended to read as follows:
7 (c) If at the conclusion of the hearing the court determines that the
8 required consents have been obtained or excused and the required period for
9 the withdrawal of consent and withdrawal of relinquishment have has passed
10 and that the adoption is in the best interest of the individual to be
11 adopted, it may (1) issue a final decree of adoption; or (2) issue an
12 interlocutory decree of adoption which by its own terms automatically becomes
13 a final decree of adoption on a day therein specified, which day shall not be
14 less than six (6) months nor more than one (1) year from the date of issuance
15 of the decree, unless sooner vacated by the court for good cause shown.
16
17 SECTION 6. Arkansas Code § 9-9-215 is amended to read as follows:
18 9-9-215. Effect of decree of adoption.
19 (a) A final decree of adoption and an interlocutory decree of adoption
20 which has become final, whether issued by a court of this state or of any
21 other place, have has the following effect as to matters within the
22 jurisdiction or before a court of this state:
23 (1) Except with respect to a spouse of the petitioner and
24 relatives of the spouse, to relieve the biological parents of the adopted
25 individual of all parental rights and responsibilities, and to terminate all
26 legal relationships between the adopted individual and his or her biological
27 relatives, including his or her biological parents, so that the adopted
28 individual thereafter is a stranger to his or her former relatives for all
29 purposes. This includes inheritance and the interpretation or construction of
30 documents, statutes, and instruments, whether executed before or after the
31 adoption is decreed, which do not expressly include the individual by name or
32 by some designation not based on a parent and child or blood relationship.
33 However, in cases where a biological or adoptive parent dies before a
34 petition for adoption has been filed by a step-parent of the minor to be
35 adopted, the court may grant visitation rights to the parents of the deceased
36 biological or adoptive parent of the child if such parents of the deceased
4 04-07-2025 12:24:56 LJH275

As Engrossed: S4/7/25 SB599
1 biological or adoptive parent had a close relationship with the child prior
2 to the filing of a petition for step-parent adoption, and if such visitation
3 rights are in the best interests of the child. The foregoing provision shall
4 not apply to the parents of a deceased putative father who has not legally
5 established his paternity prior to the filing of a petition for adoption by a
6 step-parent. For the purposes of this section, “step-parent” means an
7 individual who is the spouse or surviving spouse of the biological or
8 adoptive parent of a child but who is not a biological or adoptive parent of
9 the child.
10 (2) To create the relationship of parent and child between
11 petitioner and the adopted individual, as if the adopted individual were a
12 legitimate blood descendant of the petitioner, for all purposes including
13 inheritance and applicability of statutes, documents, and instruments,
14 whether executed before or after the adoption is decreed, which do not
15 expressly exclude an adopted individual from their operation or effect.
16 (b) An interlocutory decree of adoption, while it is in force, has the
17 same legal effect as a final decree of adoption. If an interlocutory decree
18 of adoption is vacated, it shall be as though void from its issuance, and the
19 rights, liabilities, and status of all affected persons which have not become
20 vested shall be governed accordingly.
21 (c) Sibling visitation shall not terminate if the adopted child was in
22 the custody of the Department of Human Services and had a sibling who was not
23 adopted by the same family and before adoption the circuit court in the
24 juvenile dependency-neglect or families-in-need-of-services case has
25 determined that it is in the best interests of the siblings to visit and has
26 ordered visitation between the siblings to occur after the adoption.
27
28 SECTION 7. Arkansas Code § 9-9-219 is amended to read as follows:
29 9-9-219. Application for new birth record.
30 Upon entry of a final decree of adoption or an interlocutory decree of
31 adoption that does not require a subsequent hearing, the clerk of the court
32 shall prepare an application for a birth record in the new name of the
33 adopted individual and forward the application to the appropriate vital
34 statistics office of the place, if known, where the adopted individual was
35 born and forward a copy of the decree to the Division of Vital Records for
36 statistical purposes. The division may issue a birth certificate for any
5 04-07-2025 12:24:56 LJH275

1 child born in a place whose law does not provide for the issuance of a
2 substituted certificate.

4 SECTION 8. Arkansas Code § 9-9-220(a), concerning the termination of
5 parental rights by virtue of the entry of a decree of adoption under the
6 Revised Uniform Adoption Act, is amended to read as follows:
7 (a) With the exception of the duty to pay child support, the rights of
8 a parent with reference to a child, including parental right to control the
9 child or to withhold consent to an adoption, may be relinquished and the
10 relationship of parent and child terminated in or prior to an adoption
11 proceeding as provided in this section. The duty of a parent to pay child
12 support shall continue until an interlocutory a decree of adoption is
13 entered.
14
15 SECTION 9. Arkansas Code § 9-14-237(a)(1), concerning the duty of a
16 payor parent to pay child support automatically terminating by operation of
17 law, is amended to read as follows:
18 (a)(1) Unless a court order for child support specifically extends
19 child support after these circumstances, a payor parent's duty to pay child
20 support for a child shall automatically terminate by operation of law:
21 (A) When the child reaches eighteen (18) years of age
22 unless the child is still attending high school;
23 (B) If the child is still attending high school, upon the
24 child's high school graduation or the end of the school year after the child
25 reaches nineteen (19) years of age, whichever is earlier;
26 (C) When the child:
27 (i) Is emancipated by a court of competent
28 jurisdiction;
29 (ii) Marries; or
30 (iii) Dies;
31 (D) Upon the marriage of the parents of the child to each
32 other; or
33 (E) Upon the entry of a final decree of adoption or an
34 interlocutory decree of adoption that has become final under the Revised
35 Uniform Adoption Act, § 9-9-201 et seq., and, thereby relieves relieving the
36 payor parent of all parental rights and responsibilities.
