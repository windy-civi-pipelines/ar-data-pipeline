13
14 NOW THEREFORE,
15 BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NINETY-FIFTH GENERAL
16 ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN:
17
18 THAT the General Assembly respectfully request that the members of the
19 Arkansas congressional delegation introduce federal legislation to:
20 (a)(1) Require the United States Office of Management and Budget to
21 report to the United States Congress to assess whether the application of
22 budget rules to the Nuclear Waste Fund, 42 U.S.C. § 10222(c), complies with
23 42 U.S.C. § 10222(d), as it existed on January 1, 2025.
24 (2) The Nuclear Waste Fund, 42 U.S.C. § 10222, as it existed on
25 January 1, 2025, differs from all other federal trust funds because it was
26 established under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, 42 U.S.C. § 10101 et
27 seq., as it existed on January 1, 2025, as a fee paid to the United States
28 Department of Energy for a specific service of disposing of nuclear waste.
29 (3) Waste generators were required to execute contracts, making
30 this arrangement unique compared to other federal trust funds.
31 (4) The United States Office of Management and Budget report to
32 the United States Congress that is requested under this resolution shall:
33 (A) Verify that receipts from nuclear utility fee
34 collections were deposited into the United States Treasury in the fiscal year
35 they were collected and credited to the Nuclear Waste Fund, 42 U.S.C. §
36 10222, as it existed on January 1, 2025, as assets available for
3 03/20/2025 3:07:06 PM ANS435
HCR1009
1 discretionary appropriations;
2 (B) Confirm that this revenue was accounted for as a
3 negative direct spending item, thereby reducing total federal direct spending
4 in the fiscal year of collection;
5 (C) Address concerns that this accounting method
6 inappropriately uses contract fee income, which is statutorily designated
7 exclusively for the purposes of radioactive waste disposal activities under
8 42 U.S.C. § 10222(d), as it existed on January 1, 2025, as a means of
9 reducing discretionary spending caps; and
10 (D) Provide recommendations to rectify any deficiencies
11 identified in the current budgeting treatment of the Nuclear Waste Fund, 42
12 U.S.C. § 10222, as it existed on January 1, 2025;
13 (b) Appropriate ten million dollars ($10,000,000) from the Nuclear
14 Waste Fund, 42 U.S.C. § 10222, as it existed on January 1, 2025, for an
15 updated fee assessment.
16 (c) Allocate the amount under subsection (b) of this resolution from
17 the Nuclear Waste Fund, 42 U.S.C. § 10222, as it existed on January 1, 2025,
18 to the United States Department of Energy for a contract with an institution
19 of higher education in this state to conduct an updated fee assessment as
20 required by 42 U.S.C. § 10222(a)(4), as it existed on January 1, 2025.
21 (d) The updated fee assessment under subsection (c) of this resolution
22 shall evaluate the cost implications of three (3) distinct spent nuclear fuel
23 disposal plans, including:
24 (1)(A)(i) The "Kicking the Can Down the Road" for continued on-
25 site storage.
26 (ii) The "Kicking the Can Down the Road" scenario
27 assumes that nuclear waste remains stored at reactor sites indefinitely.
28 (iii) The United States Department of Energy
29 annually updates its estimated liability for failing to dispose of the
30 nuclear waste, which as of November 2024, ranged between thirty seven billion
31 six hundred million dollars ($37,600,000,000) and forty-four billion five
32 hundred million dollars ($44,500,000,000).
33 (iv) However, the liability estimate under
34 subdivision (d)(1)(A)(iii) of this resolution is not a fee assessment but
35 rather the net present value of annual payments due to contract default.
36 (B) The fee assessment for this plan shall include a
4 03/20/2025 3:07:06 PM ANS435
HCR1009
1 special calculation for new waste generators that have not contributed to the
2 Nuclear Waste Fund, similar to 42 U.S.C. § 10222(a)(3), as it existed on
3 January 1, 2025.
4 (C) For reference, Arkansas Nuclear One has a credit
5 balance of approximately one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000), generating
6 thirty million dollars ($30,000,000) annually in interest income.
7 (D) With an average waste output of thirty metric tons (30
8 mt) per year, the estimated cost is one million dollars ($1,000,000) per
9 metric tons per year.
10 (E)(i) Reactors that came online after the District of
11 Columbia Circuit Court's ruling in Nat'l Ass'n of Regulatory Util. Comm'rs v.
12 U.S. Dep't of Energy, 736 F.3d 517 (D.C. Cir. 2013), set the United States
13 Department of Energy's fee to zero (0) include:
14 (a) Watts Bar Unit 2 (1,167 MW), completed in
15 2015;
16 (b) Vogtle Unit 3 (1,250 MW), completed in
17 July 2023; and
18 (c) Vogtle Unit 4 (1,250 MW), completed in
19 April 2024.
20 (ii)(a) These reactors generate nuclear waste yet
21 have not contributed to the Nuclear Waste Fund.
22 (b) The fee assessment shall establish parity
23 with existing reactors and account for disposal cost variations for different
24 waste types, including:
25 (1) Uranium oxide used fuel;
26 (2) MOX fuel;
27 (3) Molten salt reactor fuel;
28 (4) TRISO fuel (Tri-structural Isotropic
29 particle fuel); and
30 (5) Uranium metal fuel.
31 (2)(A) Refunding the Yucca Mountain Project;
32 (B) Despite political opposition, current law designates
33 the Yucca Mountain Project as the sole federal nuclear waste repository.
34 (C) The Yucca Mountain Project site has undergone
35 extensive study and remains legally authorized with a statutory disposal
36 limit of seventy-seven thousand metric tons (77,000 mt).
5 03/20/2025 3:07:06 PM ANS435
HCR1009
1 (D) Nevada does not have legal standing to halt the Yucca
2 Mountain Project.
3 (E) The disposal plan requires only an updated budget for
4 the Yucca Mountain Project and a United States Department of Energy
5 recommendation for a second site, along with an associated budget.
6 (F) If the Yucca Mountain Project is abandoned, nuclear
7 waste generators could demand a refund with interest, as 42 U.S.C. § 10222(d)
8 explicitly states that disposal fees may only be used for the purpose of
9 radioactive waste disposal activities; and
10 (3) The recycling nuclear fuel or the "Arkansas Plan" proposes
11 recycling spent nuclear fuel using fast reactor technology, as detailed in
12 the General Assembly’s official report considering the following:
13 (A) Arkansas Fuel Rod Report that is based on:
14 (i) The Experimental Breeder Reactor II program;
15 (ii) Recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission
16 on America’s Nuclear Future; and
17 (iii) France’s unified reactor development policy;
18 and
19 (B) Notably, in a June 27, 1994, letter to the United
20 States Senate, then-Secretary of Energy Hazel O’Leary stated:
21 “No further testing of the Integral Fast Reactor concept is required to prove
22 the technical feasibility of actinide recycling and burning in a fast
23 reactor, such as the experimental breeder reactor in Idaho. The basic physics
24 and chemistry of this technology are well-established.”
25 (e)(1) The State of Arkansas’ Expression of Interest is needed for
26 congressional funding for the United States Department of Energy and
27 institution of higher education in this state contract and the General
28 Assembly’s approval of this resolution shall constitute the State of
29 Arkansas’ "Expression of Interest" under the United States Department of
30 Energy’s Consent-Based Siting Program.
31 (2) Importantly, this Expression of Interest does not commit the
32 State of Arkansas or an institution of higher education to any action beyond
33 conducting the fee assessment.
34
35 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT upon its adoption, a copy of this resolution be
36 transmitted to the Arkansas congressional delegation by the Chief Clerk of

10 (3) The recycling nuclear fuel or the "Arkansas Plan" proposes
11 recycling spent nuclear fuel using fast reactor technology, as detailed in
12 the General Assembly’s official report considering the following:
13 (A) Arkansas Fuel Rod Report that is based on:
14 (i) The Experimental Breeder Reactor II program;
15 (ii) Recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Commission
16 on America’s Nuclear Future; and
17 (iii) France’s unified reactor development policy;
18 and
19 (B) Notably, in a June 27, 1994, letter to the United
20 States Senate, then-Secretary of Energy Hazel O’Leary stated:
21 “No further testing of the Integral Fast Reactor concept is required to prove
22 the technical feasibility of actinide recycling and burning in a fast
23 reactor, such as the experimental breeder reactor in Idaho. The basic physics
24 and chemistry of this technology are well-established.”
25 (e)(1) The State of Arkansas’ Expression of Interest is needed for
26 congressional funding for the United States Department of Energy and
27 institution of higher education in this state contract and the General
28 Assembly’s approval of this resolution shall constitute the State of
29 Arkansas’ "Expression of Interest" under the United States Department of
30 Energy’s Consent-Based Siting Program.
31 (2) Importantly, this Expression of Interest does not commit the
32 State of Arkansas or an institution of higher education to any action beyond
33 conducting the fee assessment.

35 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT upon its adoption, a copy of this resolution be
36 transmitted to the Arkansas congressional delegation by the Chief Clerk of
