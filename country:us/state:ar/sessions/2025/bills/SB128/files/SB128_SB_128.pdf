20 03-17-2025 16:22:29 HAR039

As Engrossed: S3/17/25 SB128
1 position established under this section shall not exceed the salary rate of
2 the highest maximum annual salary rate authorized by the General Assembly in
3 the institution's appropriation act. These positions are to be used by the
4 University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in the event that the personal
5 services needs of the University during the 2024-2025 2025-2026 fiscal year
6 exceed the number of positions allocated to the University by the
7 Legislature. The University shall provide justification to the Arkansas
8 Division of Higher Education for the need to allocate titles from this
9 "growth pool". No classifications titles will be assigned to the pool until
10 such time as specific positions are requested by the University, approved by
11 the University Board or their designee, and approved by the Legislative
12 Council or Joint Budget Committee. Furthermore, the Arkansas Division of
13 Higher Education shall establish and maintain for the 2024-2025 fiscal year a
14 pool of three hundred (300) career service positions up to a C130. These
15 positions are to be used by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
16 in the event that the personal services needs of the University during the
17 2024-2025 fiscal year exceed the number of positions in a classification
18 allocated to the University by the Legislature. The University shall provide
19 justification to the Arkansas Division of Higher Education for the need to
20 allocate titles from this "growth pool". No classifications will be assigned
21 to the pool until such time as specific positions are requested by the
22 University, recommended by the Arkansas Division of Higher Education, and
23 approved by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee.
24 (b) Determining the number of personnel to be employed by a state agency
25 is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by
26 delineating the maximum number of personnel by identifying the job titles and
27 the maximum grade or salary attached to those salaries. The General Assembly
28 has determined that the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences could be
29 operated more efficiently if some flexibility is given to that institution.
30 That flexibility is being accomplished by providing growth pools in
31 subsection (a) of this section and since the General Assembly has granted the
32 institution broad powers under the growth pool concept, it is both necessary
33 and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight of the
34 utilization of the growth pool by requiring prior approval of the Legislative
35 Council or Joint Budget Committee in the utilization of the growth pool.
36 Therefore, the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint
21 03-17-2025 16:22:29 HAR039

19 collaboration of professionals, CHFLI shall provide a statewide effort to
20 explore, develop and evaluate new and better ways to address medically,
21 socially and economically interrelated health and developmental needs of
22 children with special health care needs and their families. CHFLI priorities
23 shall include, but are not limited to, wellness and prevention, screening and

21 personnel, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences or its successor
22 is authorized for the 2024-2025 2025-2026 fiscal year a pool of seven hundred
23 (700) "Clinical Expansion and Research Pool" positions. These positions are
24 to be used by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in the event
25 that the personal services needs resulting from unanticipated clinical or
26 research programs that are initiated during the 2024-2025 2025-2026 fiscal
27 year require additional positions, either in title, in classification, or in
28 number, that are not authorized or contemplated by the General Assembly in
29 the Regular Salaries - Operations section of this Act.
30 (b) The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences is authorized to
31 access the "Clinical Expansion and Research Pool" positions authorized in
32 this Section at any time during the fiscal year when it is determined by the
33 Chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, subject to the
34 review and approval by the Board of Trustees, that the need for additional
35 positions exists. Only medical or research positions shall be established

As Engrossed: S3/17/25 SB128

2 of allocation of positions from this "Clinical Expansion and Research Pool"
3 to the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, to the Arkansas Division of Higher
4 Education, and to the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
5 for review. The report shall also include an accounting of the names, titles
6 and salaries of personnel who have been employed in positions established
7 from this pool and the source and duration of funds associated with the
8 positions.
9 (c) If the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences requests
10 continuation of any "Clinical Expansion and Research Pool" position(s) as
11 established herein during the next fiscal year, the position(s) must be
12 requested as a new position(s) in the agency's budget request.
13 (d) Determining the number of personnel to be employed by a state agency
14 is the prerogative of the General Assembly and is usually accomplished by
15 delineating the maximum number of personnel by identifying job titles and the
16 maximum grade or salary attached to those titles. The General Assembly has
17 determined that the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences could be

19 That flexibility is being accomplished by providing a position pool in

22 appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization
23 of the position pool by requiring review of the Legislative Council or Joint
24 Budget Committee in the utilization of the position pool. Therefore, the

27 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a
28 court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.

14 stipulate the terms of the agreement and reporting requirements; an amount
15 not to exceed fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) may be utilized for

12 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
13 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
14 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
15 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
16 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
17 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
18 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
19 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
20 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
21 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
