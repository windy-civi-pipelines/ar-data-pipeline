12 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
13 LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General Assembly, in the
14 transition to a state-funded victim assistance system, to provide an
15 appropriation and adequate level of victim services in all areas of the
16 state. It is recognized by the General Assembly that in many areas of the
17 state, resources have not been available to support victim services at the
18 necessary level to comply with statutory requirements and other duties as
19 assigned by the prosecuting attorney. With the transition of local funding
20 of victim assistance coordinator salaries to state funding, it is not the
21 intent of the General Assembly to adversely affect those districts whose
22 system has been working well or to implement a system which is too inflexible
23 to respond to the needs of each judicial district. Therefore, the
24 Prosecution Coordination Commission is charged with the responsibility of
25 assisting in the maintenance of a system which equitably serves all areas of
26 the state by providing quality victim assistance coordinators.
27 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from October 1,
28 2025 to June 30, 2026.

34 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
35 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
36 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
