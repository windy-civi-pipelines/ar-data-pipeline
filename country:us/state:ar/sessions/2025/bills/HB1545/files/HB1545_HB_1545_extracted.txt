19 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
20 (a) The General Assembly finds:
21 (1) Arkansas adopted the Interstate Compact on Educational

26 expanding eligibility and resources offered to uniformed services families;
27 (3) Arkansas is the only state that has taken an independent,
28 parallel path outside of the compact to better serve our highly mobile
29 uniformed services families;
30 (4) On December 31, 2024, the United States Department of
31 Defense reported to the United States Congress that, "States could consider
32 the benefits of implementing the Arkansas model for a statute outside the
33 Compact"; and
34 (5) Arkansas is recognized for initiative, innovation, and
35 responsiveness to meeting emerging needs of uniformed services families.
36 (b) This act further improves the Arkansas Military Child School
