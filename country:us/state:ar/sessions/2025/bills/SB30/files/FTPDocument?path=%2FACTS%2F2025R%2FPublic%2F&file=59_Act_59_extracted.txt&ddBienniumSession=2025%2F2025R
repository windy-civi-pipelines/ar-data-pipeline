26 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFER
27 RESTRICTIONS. The appropriations provided in this act shall not be
28 transferred under the provisions of Arkansas Code 19-4-522, but only as
29 provided by this act.
30 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
31 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
32
33 SECTION 4. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
34 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFERS
35 OF APPROPRIATIONS. In the event the amount of any of the budget
36 classifications of maintenance and general operation in this act are found by
2 01/06/2025 3:45:58 PM MAH008
SB30
1 the administrative head of the agency to be inadequate, then the agency head
2 may request, upon forms provided for such purpose by the Chief Fiscal Officer
3 of the State, a modification of the amounts of the budget classification. In
4 that event, he shall set out on the forms the particular classifications for
5 which he is requesting an increase or decrease, the amounts thereof, and his
6 reasons therefor. In no event shall the total amount of the budget exceed
7 either the amount of the appropriation or the amount of the funds available,
8 nor shall any transfer be made from the capital outlay or data processing
9 subclassifications unless specific authority for such transfers is provided
10 by law, except for transfers from capital outlay to data processing when
11 determined by the Department of Transformation & Shared Services - Division
12 of Information Systems that data processing services for a state agency can
13 be performed on a more cost-efficient basis by the Department of
14 Transformation & Shared Services - Division of Information Systems than
15 through the purchase of data processing equipment by that state agency. In
16 considering the proposed modification as prepared and submitted by each state
17 agency, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall make such studies as he
18 deems necessary. The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall, after obtaining
19 the approval of the Legislative Council, approve the requested transfer if in
20 his opinion it is in the best interest of the state.
21 The General Assembly has determined that the agency in this act could be
22 operated more efficiently if some flexibility is given to that agency and
23 that flexibility is being accomplished by providing authority to transfer
24 between certain items of appropriation made by this act. Since the General
25 Assembly has granted the agency broad powers under the transfer of
26 appropriations, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
27 Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the transfers by requiring
28 prior approval of the Legislative Council in the utilization of the transfer
29 authority. Therefore, the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council
30 is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by
31 the Legislative Council is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent
32 jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
33 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
34 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

1 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
2 POSITIONS. (a) Nothing in this act shall be construed as a commitment of the
3 State of Arkansas or any of its agencies or institutions to continue funding
4 any position paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement in the event
5 that Tobacco Settlement funds are not sufficient to finance the position.
6 (b) State funds will not be used to replace Tobacco Settlement funds when
7 such funds expire, unless appropriated by the General Assembly and authorized
8 by the Governor.
9 (c) A disclosure of the language contained in (a) and (b) of this Section
10 shall be made available to all new hire and current positions paid from the
11 proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement by the Tobacco Settlement Commission.
12 (d) Whenever applicable the information contained in (a) and (b) of this
13 Section shall be included in the employee handbook and/or Professional
14 Services Contract paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement.
15 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024

18 SECTION 6. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
19 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
20 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds authorized by this act
21 shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency and funds made
22 available by law for the support of such appropriations; and the restrictions
23 of the State Purchasing Law, the General Accounting and Budgetary Procedures
24 Law, the Regular Salary Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors,
25 and other fiscal control laws of this State, where applicable, and
26 regulations promulgated by the Department of Finance and Administration, as
27 authorized by law, shall be strictly complied with in disbursement of said
28 funds.
29 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024

32 SECTION 7. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
33 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
34 LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General Assembly that any funds

2 Executive Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the
3 budget manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration,
4 letters, or summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas
5 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and
6 adoption.
7 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
8 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
9
10 SECTION 8. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
11 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
12 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
13 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
14 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
15 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
16 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
17 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
18 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
19 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
20 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
