1 and management of pharmacy benefits; and

8 or pharmacist that meets relevant and reasonable participation criteria may
9 join a pharmacy benefits manager network consistent with state and federal
10 law, as most healthcare insurers contract with pharmacy benefits managers to
11 administer pharmacy benefits.
