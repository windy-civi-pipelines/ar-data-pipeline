25 SECTION 2. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
26 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that this state lacks sufficient
27 alternative care settings for children with medically complex conditions;
28 that due to lack of sufficient alternative care settings, children with
29 medically complex conditions often have unnecessary hospitalizations, which
30 results in increased expenditures to the state and in the Arkansas Medicaid
31 Program; that unnecessary hospitalizations in children can lead to
32 preventable harm, including infections; and that this act is immediately
33 necessary because increasing alternative care settings for children with
34 medically complex conditions protects the health of the children of this
35 state. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being
36 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and
