JMB602 - 03-28-2025 10:28:23 Amendment No. 1 to House Bill 1270 Page 3 of 4
alternative care settings for children with medically complex conditions;
that due to lack of sufficient alternative care settings, children with
medically complex conditions often have unnecessary hospitalizations, which
results in increased expenditures to the state and in the Arkansas Medicaid
Program; that unnecessary hospitalizations in children can lead to
preventable harm, including infections; and that this act is immediately
necessary because increasing alternative care settings for children with
medically complex conditions protects the health of the children of this
state. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and
safety shall become effective on:
(1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
(2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
bill; or
(3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto."
