1 Secretary of the Department of Commerce that a reallocation of resources for
2 purposes of reorganization or consolidation of administrative functions
3 within or between divisions is necessary for efficient and effective
4 operations of the department, the Secretary, with approval of the Governor
5 and prior approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee,
6 shall have the authority to request from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the
7 State, a transfer of positions, appropriations, programs, and funds between
8 divisions or other budgetary units of the department. The transfers of
9 positions, programs, or activities shall be used for those purposes for which
10 the appropriations were approved by the General Assembly. Upon approval by
11 the Governor, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall request to
12 the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, a transfer of positions, programs,
13 funds, appropriations, and/or line-item appropriations within or between
14 existing and newly created divisions, offices, sections and/or units. The
15 Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall then initiate the necessary transfer
16 documents to reflect transfers upon the fiscal records of the State
17 Treasurer, the State Auditor, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, and
18 Divisions of the Commerce Department. Provided, however, that the Secretary

20 transfer requests during any fiscal year.
21 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of

24 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
25 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
26 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
27 has determined that the Department of Commerce may operate more efficiently
28 if some flexibility is provided to the Department of Commerce under the
29 Reallocation of Resources provisions herein. Therefore, it is both necessary
30 and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring
31 prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as
32 provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative
33 Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section.
34 If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
