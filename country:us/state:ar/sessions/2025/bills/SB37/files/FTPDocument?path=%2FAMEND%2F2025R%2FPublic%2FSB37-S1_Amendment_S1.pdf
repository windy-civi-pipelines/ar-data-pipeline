assistance grants for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, the following:
ITEM FISCAL YEAR
NO. 2025-2026
(01) COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM $10,000,000"
SECTION 35. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES - DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. Upon determination by the
Secretary of the Department of Commerce that a reallocation of resources for
purposes of reorganization or consolidation of administrative functions
within or between divisions is necessary for efficient and effective
operations of the department, the Secretary, with approval of the Governor
and prior approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee,
shall have the authority to request from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the
State, a transfer of positions, appropriations, programs, and funds between
divisions or other budgetary units of the department. The transfers of
positions, programs, or activities shall be used for those purposes for which
the appropriations were approved by the General Assembly. Upon approval by
the Governor, the Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall request to
the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, a transfer of positions, programs,
funds, appropriations, and/or line-item appropriations within or between
existing and newly created divisions, offices, sections and/or units. The
Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall then initiate the necessary transfer
documents to reflect transfers upon the fiscal records of the State
Treasurer, the State Auditor, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State, and
Divisions of the Commerce Department. Provided, however, that the Secretary
shall be limited to submitting no more than two (2) individual transaction
transfer requests during any fiscal year.
Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year
is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
has determined that the Department of Commerce may operate more efficiently
MAH039 - 04-02-2025 12:04:50 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 37 Page 7 of 9

if some flexibility is provided to the Department of Commerce under the
Reallocation of Resources provisions herein. Therefore, it is both necessary
and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring
prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as
provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative
Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section.
If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court jurisdiction, this entire
section is void.
The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1,
2025 through June 30, 2026."
and
Appropriately renumber all the SECTION numbers of the bill.
