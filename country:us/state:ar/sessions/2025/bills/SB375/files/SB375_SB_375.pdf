19 TO CREATE THE OFFENSE OF CAPITAL RAPE;
20 AND TO AMEND A PORTION OF ARKANSAS CODE
21 WHICH RESULTED FROM INITIATED ACT 3 OF
22 1936.
23
24 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
25
26 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings.
27 The General Assembly finds that:
28 (1) Adults who rape children “are the epitome of moral
29 depravity.” Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 467 (2008) (Alito, J.,
30 dissenting);
31 (2) The United States Supreme Court gravely erred in Kennedy v.
32 Louisiana when it held that the Eight Amendment prohibited imposition of the
33 death penalty for rape of a child when the crime did not result in death of
34 the victim;
35 (3) The United States Supreme Court reached its conclusion by
36 asking whether “standards of decency” had evolved to render a death sentence
*CEB074*
03/04/2025 1:57:07 PM CEB074

SB375
1 for child rapists unconstitutional;
2 (4) To determine prevailing standards of decency, the United
3 States Supreme Court canvassed the statutes of the fifty states and the
4 United States Government and found that only six (6) states allowed the death
5 penalty for child rape;
6 (5) The outcome in Kennedy v. Louisiana may have been different
7 if more states had statutes providing that child rapists could receive the
8 death penalty;
9 (6)(A) In Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), the litigants,
10 and some Justices of the United States Supreme Court, presumed that the death
11 penalty itself was unconstitutional, but in the years following that
12 decision, a majority of states enacted new capital punishment statutes.
13 (B) The United State Supreme Court cited that wave of
14 enactments as important evidence supporting the constitutionality of the
15 death penalty in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 179-81 (1976); and
16 (7) The State of Arkansas believes that the harms caused by
17 child rapists can warrant capital punishment.
18

20 to add an additional section to read as follows:

36 (b)(1)(A)(ii) of this section.

2 are held to be unconstitutional, capital rape shall be a Class Y felony with
