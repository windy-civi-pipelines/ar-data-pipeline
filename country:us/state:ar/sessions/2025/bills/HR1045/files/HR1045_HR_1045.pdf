20 WHEREAS, more than a century ago, hunters and anglers were among the
21 first conservationists who realized America’s natural resources were in peril
22 and could not sustain unregulated harvesting and habitat destruction; and
23
24 WHEREAS, sportsmen and sportswomen took it upon themselves to support
25 laws that stopped excessive harvesting of fish and wildlife, established
26 state agencies to protect fish, wildlife, and their habitats, and supported
27 special fishing and hunting license fees to help fund the new agencies’
28 efforts to provide healthy natural resources for future generations; and
29
30 WHEREAS, the House of Representatives then and now recognizes that the
31 primary authority to protect and manage fish within Arkansas's waters resides
32 in the state agencies; and
33
34 WHEREAS, upon realizing that license fees alone were insufficient to
35 restore and sustain healthy fish populations, anglers supported excise taxes
36 on fishing equipment to raise additional funds to support restoration and

3 WHEREAS, the Sport Fish Restoration Program, which began seventy-five
4 (75) years ago with the passage of the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration
5 Act in 1950 is a vital part of conservation funding in the United States; and
6
7 WHEREAS, the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act was further
8 expanded with the Wallop-Breaux amendment in 1984; and
9
10 WHEREAS, a manufacturers excise tax on fishing equipment, along with an
11 excise tax on motorboat and small engine fuels, is mostly distributed back to
12 the states through the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for fisheries
13 conservation, management, and angler and boater access; and
14
15 WHEREAS, this cooperative partnership between the sportfishing
16 industry, anglers, boaters, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and
17 state natural resource agencies has resulted in the most successful model of
18 fisheries management in the world, restoring and enhancing populations across
19 the United States and its territories; and
20
21 WHEREAS, since 1939, the combined contribution of the Wildlife and
22 Sport Fish Restoration Program, and license fees to state fish and wildlife
23 agencies exceeds seventy-eight billion dollars ($78,000,000,000) and this is
24 more than any other single conservation effort in American history,
25

29
30 THAT the House of Representatives recognize America’s anglers, boaters,

34 abundance we see today with the help of the Sport Fish Restoration Program,
35 in this the seventy-fifth (75th) anniversary year of the program’s
36 establishment as part of the American System of Conservation Funding.
