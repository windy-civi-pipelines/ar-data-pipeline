10 approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The
11 Division of Medical Services shall have the authority to reduce or increase
12 rates based on the approved methodology. Further, the Division of Medical
13 Services shall have the authority to increase or decrease rates for good
14 cause including, but not limited to: (1) Identification of provider(s) who
15 can render needed services of equal quality at rates less than traditionally
16 charged and who meet the applicable federal and state laws, rules and
17 regulations pertaining to the provision of a particular service;
18 (2) Identification that a provider or group of providers has consistently
19 charged rates to the Arkansas Medicaid Program greater than to other
20 purchasers of medical services of similar size;
21 (3) The Division determines that there has been significant changes in the
22 technology or process by which services are provided by a provider or group
23 of providers which has affected the costs of providing services, or;

25 overall state budget of the Division of Medical Services.

27 providers, the CMS's inflationary forecasts (CMS Market Basket Index). Rates

29 Index or other indices will be adjusted annually except when the state budget

31 portion thereof.
32 (b) Any rate methodology changes proposed by the Division of Medical
33 Services both of a general and specific nature, shall be subject to prior
34 approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee.

1 is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
2 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
3 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
4 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly has
5 determined that the Department of Human Services – Division of Medical
6 Services may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the
7 Department of Human Services – Division of Medical Services authorizing broad
8 powers under this section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate
9 that the General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of
10 the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this
11 section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint
12 Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement
13 of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled
14 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is
15 void.
16 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
17 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

10 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
