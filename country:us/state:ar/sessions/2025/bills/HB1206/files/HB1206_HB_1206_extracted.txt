7 has determined that the Department of Education may operate more efficiently
8 if some flexibility is provided to the Commissioner of the Department of
9 Education authorizing broad powers under the Transfer Authority provision
10 herein. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General

13 requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
14 is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by
