6 FUNDING FOR LIBRARIES PROVISIONS.
7 (i) The Department of Education â€“ Arkansas State Library provides
8 grants and aid to Libraries across the state. The Arkansas State Library
9 has developed the Standards for State Aid to public libraries which creates
10 standards public libraries must meet to be eligible for state aid.
11 (ii) The Standards for State Aid to Public Libraries contains the
12 requirement that a public library shall maintain a one-mill county or city
13 property tax, and the requirement that the library have a qualified
14 librarian.
15 (iii) Less populated areas in the State may not have the ability to
16 pass and maintain a one-mill county or city property tax.
17 (iv) Due to the importance that the public library represents to rural
18 communities, the Arkansas State Library shall review and modify the
19 requirements that prevent rural public libraries from receiving state grant
20 and aid that is authorized by the General Assembly, as set out in subsection
21 (v).
22 (v) Therefore, the Arkansas State Library shall promulgate rules that
23 allow a public library to adequately demonstrate a source of revenue in lieu
24 of the requirement to maintain a one-mill county or city property tax.
25 (vi) One month prior to the distribution of state aid to public
26 libraries for the 2025 2026 Fiscal Year, the Arkansas State Library shall
27 report to the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, if
28 meeting in legislative session, the revised Standards for State Aid to Public
29 Libraries which shall address in writing the actions taken to address the
30 issues as set out in this section. The report shall include all criteria,
31 including but not limited to how a local public library may become certified
32 to receive funding from the Arkansas State Library.
33 (vii) The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July
34 1, 2024 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

36 SECTION 11. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
6 01/14/2025 4:03:19 PM KMW007
HB1127
1 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
2 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
3 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
4 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
5 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
6 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
7 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
8 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
9
10 SECTION 12. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
11 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
12 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
13 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
14 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
15 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
16 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
17 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
18
19 SECTION 13. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
20 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
21 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
22 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
23 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
24 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
25 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
26 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
27 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
28 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
29 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.

15 (iii) Less populated areas in the State may not have the ability to
16 pass and maintain a one-mill county or city property tax.
17 (iv) Due to the importance that the public library represents to rural
18 communities, the Arkansas State Library shall review and modify the
19 requirements that prevent rural public libraries from receiving state grant
20 and aid that is authorized by the General Assembly, as set out in subsection
21 (v).
22 (v) Therefore, the Arkansas State Library shall promulgate rules that
23 allow a public library to adequately demonstrate a source of revenue in lieu
24 of the requirement to maintain a one-mill county or city property tax.
25 (vi) One month prior to the distribution of state aid to public
26 libraries for the 2025 2026 Fiscal Year, the Arkansas State Library shall
27 report to the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, if
28 meeting in legislative session, the revised Standards for State Aid to Public
29 Libraries which shall address in writing the actions taken to address the
30 issues as set out in this section. The report shall include all criteria,
31 including but not limited to how a local public library may become certified
32 to receive funding from the Arkansas State Library.
33 (vii) The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July
34 1, 2024 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

HB1127
1 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
2 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
3 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
4 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
5 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
6 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
7 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be

10 SECTION 12. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
11 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
12 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
13 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
14 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
15 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
16 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
17 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
18
19 SECTION 13. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
20 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
21 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
22 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
23 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
24 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
25 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
26 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
27 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
28 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
29 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
