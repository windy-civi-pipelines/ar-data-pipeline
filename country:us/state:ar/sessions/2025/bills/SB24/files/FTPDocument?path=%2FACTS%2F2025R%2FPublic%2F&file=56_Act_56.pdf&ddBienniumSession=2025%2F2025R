26 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
27 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
28 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
29 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
30 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
31 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
32 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
33 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
34 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
