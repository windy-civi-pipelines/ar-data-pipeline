33 Promotional Items appropriation to be used in the acquisition of promotional

1 request shall be forwarded by the Arkansas Minority Health Commission to the
2 Chief Fiscal Officer of the State for processing and for prior approval by
3 the Arkansas Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee. Determining the
4 maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of appropriation and
5 general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year is the
6 prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
7 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
8 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
9 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
10 has determined that the Arkansas Minority Health Commission may operate more
11 efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the Department of Health -
12 Arkansas Minority Health Commission authorizing broad powers under this
13 Section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
14 Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative
15 Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this section. The
16 requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee
17 is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by
18 the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional
19 by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
20 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
21 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
22
23 SECTION 4. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
24 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFER
25 RESTRICTIONS. The appropriations provided in this act shall not be
26 transferred under the provisions of Arkansas Code 19-4-522, but only as
27 provided by this act.
28 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1,2024
29 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
30
31 SECTION 5. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
32 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFERS
33 OF APPROPRIATION. In the event the amount of any of the budget
34 classifications of maintenance and general operation in this act are found by
35 the administrative head of the agency to be inadequate, then the agency head
36 may request, upon forms provided for such purpose by the Chief Fiscal Officer
3 01/06/2025 3:41:11 PM MAH010

SB29
1 of the State, a modification of the amounts of the budget classification. In
2 that event, he or she shall set out on the forms the particular
3 classifications for which he or she is requesting an increase or decrease,
4 the amounts thereof, and his or her reasons therefor. In no event shall the
5 total amount of the budget exceed either the amount of the appropriation or
6 the amount of the funds available, nor shall any transfer be made from the
7 capital outlay or data processing subclassifications unless specific
8 authority for such transfers is provided by law, except for transfers from
9 capital outlay to data processing when determined by the Department of
10 Transformation & Shared Services - Division of Information Systems that data
11 processing services for a state agency can be performed on a more cost-
12 efficient basis by the Department of Transformation & Shared Services -
13 Division of Information Systems than through the purchase of data processing
14 equipment by that state agency. In considering the proposed modification as
15 prepared and submitted by each state agency, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the
16 State shall make such studies as he or she deems necessary. The Chief Fiscal
17 Officer of the State shall, after obtaining the approval of the Legislative
18 Council or Joint Budget Committee, approve the requested transfer if in his
19 or her opinion it is in the best interest of the state.
20 The General Assembly has determined that the agency in this act could be
21 operated more efficiently if some flexibility is given to that agency and
22 that flexibility is being accomplished by providing authority to transfer
23 between certain items of appropriation made by this act. Since the General
24 Assembly has granted the agency broad powers under the transfer of
25 appropriations, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
26 Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the transfers by requiring
27 prior approval of the Legislative Council in the utilization of the transfer
28 authority. Therefore, the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council
29 is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by
30 the Legislative Council is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent
31 jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
32 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1,2024
33 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

20 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds authorized by this act
21 shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency and funds made

23 of the State Purchasing Law, the General Accounting and Budgetary Procedures
24 Law, the Regular Salary Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors,

1 adopted, as evidenced by Initiated Act 1 of 2000, the Agency Requests,
2 Executive Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the
3 budget manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration,
4 letters, or summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas
5 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and

10 SECTION 9. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
11 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
12 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
13 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
14 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
15 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
16 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
17 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
18 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
19 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
20 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
