23 SECTION 72. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
24 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFER
25 PROCEDURES - VARIOUS TEMPORARY APPROPRIATION FOR STATE AGENCIES AND
26 INSTITUTIONS. (i) In the event that sufficient appropriation is not provided
27 by the General Assembly for any state agency or institution, an agency or
28 institution may request a transfer of appropriation, as provided in the
29 Various Temporary Appropriation for State Agencies and Institutions
30 Appropriation Section of this Act, from the Chief Fiscal Officer of the
31 State, stating clearly the amount requested, purpose and any additional
32 information requested by the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State.
33 (ii) After reviewing a request the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State may
34 deny, modify or approve the agencies or institutions request based on the
35 estimated amount of appropriation needed and currently available, purpose,
36 estimated funding available and preferred spending priority. Upon approval

1 or modification of a request by the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and
2 after meeting the requirements of subsection (iii) herein, the Department of
3 Finance and Administration shall establish the transfer of appropriation on
4 the books of the Department of Finance and Administration and the State
5 Auditor, in compliance with the applicable classifications of appropriations
6 as enumerated in Arkansas Code 19-4-521 through 19-4-525.
7 (iii) Any request approved as authorized in subsection (ii) herein,
8 including requests that establish a new commitment item or new appropriation
9 shall require prior approval by the Arkansas Legislative Council or if
10 meeting in Regular or Fiscal Session the Joint Budget Committee.
11 (iv) Any appropriation approved as authorized in this Section shall not be
12 carried forward to the next fiscal year and shall be identified as a change
13 level increase by the state agency or institution, if requested.
14 (v) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation for a state agency or
15 institution each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General Assembly.
16 This is usually accomplished by delineating such maximums in the
17 appropriation act(s) for a state agency or institution. Further, the General
18 Assembly has determined that a state agency or institution may operate more
19 efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the state agency or
20 institution authorizing broad powers under this section. Therefore, it is
21 both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight
22 by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
23 Committee as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the
24 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this
25 section. If the requirement or approval by the Legislative Council or Joint
26 Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent
27 jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
28 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
29 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

1 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
2 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and

15 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
16 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
17 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
18
19 SECTION 77. EFFECTIVE DATE. Section 73 of this act is effective on
20 and after January 1, 2026.
21
22 SECTION 78. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
23 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
24 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
25 effectiveness of this Act, except for Section 73, on July 1, 2025 is
26 essential to the operation of the agency for which the appropriations in this
27 Act are provided, and that in the event of an extension of the legislative
28 session, the delay in the effective date of this Act, except for Section 73,
29 beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm upon the proper
30 administration and provision of essential governmental programs. Therefore,
31 an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act, except for Section 73,
32 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
33 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
