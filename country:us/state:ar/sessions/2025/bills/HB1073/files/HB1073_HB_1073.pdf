19 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings.
20 The General Assembly finds that:
21 (1) Job creation is a priority for the state;
22 (2) The manufacturing, installation, and operation of advanced
23 energy systems is a growth industry and should be encouraged;
24 (3) The composition and structure of the nation’s energy system
25 is transitioning to a system with near zero (0) emissions to be more:
26 (A) Engaging with customers; and
27 (B) Resilient in adapting to weather-induced electrical
28 grid impacts;
29 (4) Many electric utility companies have voluntarily announced
30 goals to transition to advanced energy systems;
31 (5) Many major businesses desire to reduce their carbon
32 footprint to meet market-driven sustainability goals and may use access to
33 advanced energy systems as a determining factor for business location;
34 (6) Planning for the creation of advanced energy jobs requires
35 input from all stakeholders;
36 (7) To ensure Arkansas can fully capitalize on the many
