14 purposes and objectives:
15 1. Increase public access to EMS personnel;
16 2. Enhance the states’ ability to protect the public’s health and

1 transcript shall bear the cost of producing the transcript. A recording may

17 03-03-2025 10:28:20 JMB028

6 SECTION 13. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
7
8 A. Oversight
9 1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state
10 government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all
11 actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact’s purposes and
12 intent. The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder
13 shall have standing as statutory law.
14 2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the
15 rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state
16 pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers,
17 responsibilities or actions of the Commission.
18 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
19 process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such
20 a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the
21 Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this
22 Compact, or promulgated rules.
23 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
24 1. If the Commission determines that a member state has
25 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
26 this compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:
27 a. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and
28 other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of
29 curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and
30 b. Provide remedial training and specific technical
31 assistance regarding the default.
32 2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the
33 defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote
34 of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits
35 conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of
36 termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of
18 03-03-2025 10:28:20 JMB028

As Engrossed: H2/26/25 H3/3/25 HB1253
1 obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
2 3. Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed
3 only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
4 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the
5 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s
6 legislature, and each of the member states.
7 4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all
8 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date
9 of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date
10 of termination.
11 5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state
12 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact,
13 unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting
14 state.
15 6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission
16 by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
17 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The
18 prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
19 reasonable attorney’s fees.
20 C. Dispute Resolution
21 1. Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt
22 to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and
23 between member and non-member states.
24 2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both
25 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
26 D. Enforcement
27 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
28 shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.
29 2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in
30 the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal
31 district where the Commission has its principal offices against a member
32 state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and
33 its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both
34 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
35 necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such
36 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

3 federal or state law.

6 PERSONNEL PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
7
8 A. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact
9 statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state. The provisions, which
10 become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the
11 Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter,
12 the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the
13 implementation and administration of the compact.
14 B. Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the Commission’s
15 initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on
16 the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has
17 been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and
18 effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.
19 C. Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a
20 statute repealing the same.
21 1. A member state’s withdrawal shall not take effect until six
22 (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.
23 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
24 withdrawing state’s EMS authority to comply with the investigative and
25 adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date
26 of withdrawal.
27 D. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate
28 or prevent any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative
29 arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not
30 conflict with the provisions of this compact.
31 E. This Compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to
32 this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until
33 it is enacted into the laws of all member states.
