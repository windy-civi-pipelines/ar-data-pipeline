31 4-120-102. Legislative findings.
32 The General Assembly finds that:
33 (1) Arkansans and Americans have long valued personal privacy as
34 something that serves essential human needs of liberty, personal autonomy,
35 seclusion, family, intimacy, and other relationships, and security;
36 (2) Privacy safeguards foundational American values of self-

1 government;
2 (3) The United States and Arkansas have long protected aspects
3 of personal privacy since the nation’s founding, including through the First,
4 Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
5 Constitution and Article 2, §§ 2, 6, 8, 10, 15, 21, and 24 of the Arkansas
6 Constitution;
7 (4) The United States has a history of leadership in privacy
8 rights, passing some of the first privacy laws as early as the eighteenth
9 century and adopting one (1) of the first national privacy and data
10 protection laws globally in addition to the “fair information practice
11 principles” that have influenced laws and privacy practices around the world;
12 (5)(A) The expansion of computers, internet connectivity, mobile
13 telephones, and other digital information and communications technology has
14 magnified the risks to an individual's privacy that can occur from the
15 collection, processing, storage, or dissemination of personal information.
16 (B) The overwhelming majority of Arkansans and Americans
17 have smartphones equipped with powerful computers, immense storage capacity,
18 arrays of sensors, and the capacity to transmit information around the world
19 instantaneously.
20 (C) Some people use these devices continuously and use
21 them to store a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives.
22 (D) Arkansans increasingly have other “smart devices” such
23 as automobiles, televisions, home appliances, and wearable accessories that
24 collect, process, and transmit information linked to Arkansans and their
25 activities to entities around the world.
26 (E) Participation in modern society necessitates the
27 adoption of technology, and Arkansans who fail to embrace technological
28 advancements face significant competitive disadvantages in education,
29 employment, healthcare access, and economic opportunity;
30 (6)(A) The personal information of Arkansans and Americans has
31 been used against them to steal their identities, open financial and credit
32 accounts in their names, and do other personal and financial harm.
33 (B) Troves of Arkansan and American personal information
34 lie in the hands of state adversaries and criminals;
35 (7) The aggregation of an increasing volume of data among many
36 different entities expands the exposure to malicious actors in cyberspace and
2 04-07-2025 19:31:27 ANS146
As Engrossed: S2/27/25 S3/13/25 S4/7/25 SB258
1 the availability of personal information to such actors;
2 (8)(A) The risks of harm from privacy violations are
3 significant.
4 (B) Unwanted or unexpected disclosure of personal
5 information and loss of privacy can have devastating effects for individuals,
6 including financial fraud and loss, identity theft, and the resulting loss of
7 personal time and money, destruction of property, harassment, and even
8 potential physical injury.
9 (C) Other effects such as reputational or emotional damage
10 can be equally or even more substantial;
11 (9)(A) With the development of artificial intelligence and
12 machine learning, the potential to use personal and other information in ways
13 that replicate existing social problems has increased in scale.
14 (B) Algorithms use personal and other information to guide
15 decision-making related to critical issues, such as credit determination,
16 housing advertisements, and hiring processes, and can result in differing
17 accuracy rates;
18 (10)(A) Individuals need to feel confident that data that
19 relates to them will not be used or shared in ways that can harm themselves,
20 their families, or society.
21 (B) As such, organizations that collect, use, retain, and
22 share personal information should be subject to meaningful and effective
23 boundaries on such activities, obligated to take reasonable steps to protect
24 the privacy and security of personal information, and required to mitigate
25 privacy risks to the individuals whose data they steward; and
26 (11)(A) The majority of governments around the world already
27 impose such restrictions on businesses, but Arkansans do not yet have their
28 right to privacy protected.
29 (B) It is proper for the General Assembly to protect
30 Arkansans’ privacy rights, enforce the rights against those who collect, use,
31 retain, and share their personal information, and establish the legislative
32 framework for responsible, safe, and trustworthy technology in Arkansas.

19 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code Title 4, is amended to add an additional
20 chapter to read as follows:

22 CHAPTER 120
23 ARKANSAS DIGITAL RESPONSIBILITY, SAFETY, AND TRUST ACT
24
25 Subchapter 1 — General Provisions

28 This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Arkansas Digital
29 Responsibility, Safety, and Trust Act".
30
31 4-120-102. Legislative findings.
32 The General Assembly finds that:
33 (1) Arkansans and Americans have long valued personal privacy as
34 something that serves essential human needs of liberty, personal autonomy,
35 seclusion, family, intimacy, and other relationships, and security;
36 (2) Privacy safeguards foundational American values of self-

1 government;
2 (3) The United States and Arkansas have long protected aspects
3 of personal privacy since the nation’s founding, including through the First,
4 Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
5 Constitution and Article 2, §§ 2, 6, 8, 10, 15, 21, and 24 of the Arkansas
6 Constitution;
7 (4) The United States has a history of leadership in privacy
8 rights, passing some of the first privacy laws as early as the eighteenth
9 century and adopting one (1) of the first national privacy and data
10 protection laws globally in addition to the “fair information practice
11 principles” that have influenced laws and privacy practices around the world;
12 (5)(A) The expansion of computers, internet connectivity, mobile
13 telephones, and other digital information and communications technology has
14 magnified the risks to an individual's privacy that can occur from the
15 collection, processing, storage, or dissemination of personal information.
16 (B) The overwhelming majority of Arkansans and Americans
17 have smartphones equipped with powerful computers, immense storage capacity,
18 arrays of sensors, and the capacity to transmit information around the world
19 instantaneously.
20 (C) Some people use these devices continuously and use
21 them to store a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives.
22 (D) Arkansans increasingly have other “smart devices” such
23 as automobiles, televisions, home appliances, and wearable accessories that
24 collect, process, and transmit information linked to Arkansans and their
25 activities to entities around the world.
26 (E) Participation in modern society necessitates the
27 adoption of technology, and Arkansans who fail to embrace technological
28 advancements face significant competitive disadvantages in education,
29 employment, healthcare access, and economic opportunity;
30 (6)(A) The personal information of Arkansans and Americans has
31 been used against them to steal their identities, open financial and credit
32 accounts in their names, and do other personal and financial harm.
33 (B) Troves of Arkansan and American personal information
34 lie in the hands of state adversaries and criminals;
35 (7) The aggregation of an increasing volume of data among many
36 different entities expands the exposure to malicious actors in cyberspace and
2 04-07-2025 19:31:27 ANS146

As Engrossed: S2/27/25 S3/13/25 S4/7/25 SB258
1 the availability of personal information to such actors;
2 (8)(A) The risks of harm from privacy violations are
3 significant.
4 (B) Unwanted or unexpected disclosure of personal
5 information and loss of privacy can have devastating effects for individuals,
6 including financial fraud and loss, identity theft, and the resulting loss of
7 personal time and money, destruction of property, harassment, and even
8 potential physical injury.
9 (C) Other effects such as reputational or emotional damage
10 can be equally or even more substantial;
11 (9)(A) With the development of artificial intelligence and
12 machine learning, the potential to use personal and other information in ways
13 that replicate existing social problems has increased in scale.
14 (B) Algorithms use personal and other information to guide
15 decision-making related to critical issues, such as credit determination,
16 housing advertisements, and hiring processes, and can result in differing
17 accuracy rates;
18 (10)(A) Individuals need to feel confident that data that
19 relates to them will not be used or shared in ways that can harm themselves,
20 their families, or society.
21 (B) As such, organizations that collect, use, retain, and
22 share personal information should be subject to meaningful and effective
23 boundaries on such activities, obligated to take reasonable steps to protect
24 the privacy and security of personal information, and required to mitigate
25 privacy risks to the individuals whose data they steward; and
26 (11)(A) The majority of governments around the world already
27 impose such restrictions on businesses, but Arkansans do not yet have their
28 right to privacy protected.
29 (B) It is proper for the General Assembly to protect
30 Arkansans’ privacy rights, enforce the rights against those who collect, use,
31 retain, and share their personal information, and establish the legislative
32 framework for responsible, safe, and trustworthy technology in Arkansas.
