27 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
28 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
29 (1) The Department of Human Services currently allows providers
30 thirty-five (35) days to appeal an adverse determination before the
31 determination becomes final under 20 CAR § 706-404(a)(5);
32 (2) The thirty-five (35) day period is overly restrictive and
33 does not align with the operational realities of providers' business offices,
34 where adverse determinations arrive via mail and require time to be reviewed,
35 processed, and responded to appropriately;
36 (3) The current notice process lacks necessary details,

1 sometimes failing to include citations to specific policies, protocols, or
2 procedures, which hinders providers from adequately investigating and
3 appealing adverse decisions; and
4 (4) The inefficiency of the current process burdens both the
5 department and its contracted vendors by increasing unnecessary phone calls,
6 claims reopenings, and resubmissions which create additional administrative
7 costs and delays.
8 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to improve efficiency and
9 transparency in the Medicaid provider appeals process by:
10 (1) Extending the appeal period for providers;
11 (2) Requiring that notices of adverse decisions contain
12 comprehensive information, including citations to applicable policies and
13 procedures;
14 (3) Mandating the publication of all policies, protocols, and
15 procedural requirements utilized in making adverse decisions; and
16 (4) Ensuring that these requirements apply to the department and
17 any third-party vendors administering portions of the appeals process.
