1 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency

5 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal

10 SECTION 20. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
11 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
12 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
13 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
14 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
15 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
16 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
17 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
18
19 SECTION 21. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
20 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
21 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
22 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
23 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
24 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
25 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
26 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
27 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
28 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
29 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
