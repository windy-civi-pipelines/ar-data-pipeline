23 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative intent.
24 It is the intent of the General Assembly to:
25 (1) Reform Arkansas trust tax law to increase the state's
26 competitiveness in the financial services sector by attracting out-of-state
27 trust assets for administration by Arkansas trustees;
28 (2) Recognize that Arkansas citizens currently establish trusts
29 in foreign states to avoid trust-level taxation;
30 (3) Recognize that foreign states are reaping the benefit that
31 comes with the management and administration of trust assets in those states;
32 and
33 (4) Amend the law to remove the incentive for Arkansas residents
34 to set up nongrantor trusts in foreign states that will encourage Arkansans
35 to keep trust assets in state where Arkansas trustees will manage and
36 administer the trust assets.
