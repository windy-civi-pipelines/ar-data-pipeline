10 director, employee, and representative of the Commission in any civil action
11 seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error,

36 or regulation.

13 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
14 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
15 provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and have no force or
16 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is

18 that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted
19 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
20 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each

22 conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish the Member State’s
23 laws, regulations, and applicable standards that govern the practice of
24 Social Work as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the
25 Commission shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
26 C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to the
27 criteria set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules
28 shall become binding on the day following adoption or the date specified in

31 Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the

33 adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect
34 in any Member State.
35 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
36 Commission.
22 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393

6 hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Commission shall provide a
7 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
8 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible
9 platform;

27 written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to the
28 proposed Rule shall be available to the public.

30 hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
31 Commission at hearings required by this section.
32 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final
33 action on the proposed Rule based on the Rulemaking record and the full text
34 of the Rule.

HB1712
1 Rule.
2 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons
3 for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for
4 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.

12 Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as
13 soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
14 the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an

25 Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a
26 period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only
27 on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A
28 challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to
29 the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take
30 effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision

33 Compact.

4 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is proper
5 and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought solely
6 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal
7 office of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and
8 jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
9 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or
10 limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee
11 for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
12 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
13 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the
14 Compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
15 purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render a
16 judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated
17 Rules.
18 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
19 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
20 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
21 this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide written
22 notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the
23 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that
24 the Commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical
25 assistance regarding the default.
26 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default
27 to the other Member States.
28 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
29 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
30 majority of the delegates of the Member States, and all rights, privileges
31 and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be terminated on the
32 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
33 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
34 default.
35 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only
36 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of
25 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393
HB1712
1 intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the

15 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless
16 agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.

18 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the

21 reasonable attorney’s fees.
22 I. Dispute Resolution
23 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt
24 to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and
25 between Member and non-Member States.
26 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
27 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
28 J. Enforcement
29 1. By majority vote as provided by Rule, the Commission may
30 initiate legal action against a Member State in default in the United States
31 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
32 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
33 provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may
34 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
35 is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
36 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall
26 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393
HB1712
1 not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue
2 any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting Member State’s
3 law.
4 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
5 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the

8 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
9 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
10 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
11 3. No person other than a Member State shall enforce this
12 Compact against the Commission.
13
14 SECTION 14. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
15 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
16 statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
17 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission
18 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven Member
19 States (“Charter Member States”) to determine if the statute enacted by each
20 such Charter Member State is materially different than the model Compact
21 statute.
22 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be
23 materially different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the
24 default process set forth in Section 13.
25 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or
26 is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in

28 D. The records and information provided to a Member State pursuant to
29 this Compact or through the Data System, when certified by the Commission or
30 an agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business records of the
31 Commission, and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay exception in any
32 relevant judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings in a Member
33 State.
34 E. Current Significant Investigative Information pertaining to a
35 Licensee in any Member State will only be available to other Member States.

HB1712
1 Adverse Action against a Licensee and to monitor the database to determine
2 whether Adverse Action has been taken against a Licensee. Adverse Action
3 information pertaining to a Licensee in any Member State will be available to

11
12 SECTION 12. RULEMAKING
13 A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
14 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
15 provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and have no force or
16 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is
17 invalid because the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner
18 that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted
19 hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
20 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each
21 Member State, provided however that where the Rules of the Commission
22 conflict with the laws of the Member State that establish the Member State’s
23 laws, regulations, and applicable standards that govern the practice of
24 Social Work as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the
25 Commission shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
26 C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to the
27 criteria set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules
28 shall become binding on the day following adoption or the date specified in
29 the rule or amendment, whichever is later.
30 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a
31 Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the
32 same manner used to adopt the Compact within four (4) years of the date of
33 adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect
34 in any Member State.
35 E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the
36 Commission.
22 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393

HB1712
1 F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall hold a
2 public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data,
3 facts, opinions, and arguments.
4 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and at
5 least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the Commission will
6 hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Commission shall provide a
7 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:
8 1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible
9 platform;
10 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Commission’s
11 notices of proposed rulemaking; and
12 3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule specify.
13 H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:
14 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which
15 the Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if
16 different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the Commission
17 will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
18 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video
19 conference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall include the
20 mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking;
21 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor;
22 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any
23 interested person; and
24 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written
25 comments.
26 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
27 written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to the
28 proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
29 J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate
30 hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the
31 Commission at hearings required by this section.
32 K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final
33 action on the proposed Rule based on the Rulemaking record and the full text
34 of the Rule.
35 1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule
36 provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed
23 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393

HB1712
1 Rule.
2 2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons
3 for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons for
4 substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
5 3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date
6 for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Section 12.L., the
7 effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the
8 notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
9 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
10 consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 48 hours’ notice, with opportunity
11 to comment, provided that the usual Rulemaking procedures provided in the
12 Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as
13 soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after
14 the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this provision, an
15 emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:
16 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
17 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;
18 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
19 established by federal law or rule; or
20 4. Protect public health and safety.
21 M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may
22 direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting
23 typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical
24 errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the
25 Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a
26 period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only
27 on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A
28 challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to
29 the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take
30 effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision
31 may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.
32 N. No Member State’s rulemaking requirements shall apply under this
33 Compact.
34
35 SECTION 13. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
36 A. Oversight
24 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393

HB1712
1 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
2 each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary
3 and appropriate to implement the Compact.
4 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is proper
5 and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought solely
6 and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal
7 office of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and
8 jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in
9 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or
10 limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee
11 for professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.
12 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
13 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the
14 Compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
15 purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render a
16 judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated
17 Rules.
18 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
19 1. If the Commission determines that a Member State has
20 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
21 this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide written
22 notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the
23 default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that
24 the Commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical
25 assistance regarding the default.
26 2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default
27 to the other Member States.
28 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
29 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
30 majority of the delegates of the Member States, and all rights, privileges
31 and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be terminated on the
32 effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the
33 offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of
34 default.
35 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only
36 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of
25 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393

HB1712
1 intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the
2 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State’s
3 legislature, the defaulting State’s State Licensing Authority and each of the
4 Member States’ State Licensing Authority.
5 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
6 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date
7 of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date
8 of termination.
9 F. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this Compact,
10 that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that
11 State of such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize
12 all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months
13 after the date of said notice of termination.
14 G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is
15 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless
16 agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.
17 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by
18 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
19 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices. The
20 prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including
21 reasonable attorney’s fees.
22 I. Dispute Resolution
23 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt
24 to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and
25 between Member and non-Member States.
26 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
27 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
28 J. Enforcement
29 1. By majority vote as provided by Rule, the Commission may
30 initiate legal action against a Member State in default in the United States
31 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the
32 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
33 provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may
34 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
35 is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
36 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall
26 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393

HB1712
1 not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue
2 any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting Member State’s
3 law.
4 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the
5 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
6 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce
7 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The
8 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
9 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
10 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
11 3. No person other than a Member State shall enforce this
12 Compact against the Commission.
13
14 SECTION 14. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
15 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
16 statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
17 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission
18 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven Member
19 States (“Charter Member States”) to determine if the statute enacted by each
20 such Charter Member State is materially different than the model Compact
21 statute.
22 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be
23 materially different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the
24 default process set forth in Section 13.
25 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or
26 is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall remain in
27 existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of Member
28 States should be less than seven.
29 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven
30 initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in
31 Section 10.C.21. to determine if their enactments are materially different
32 from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in
33 the Compact.
34 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
35 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the
36 effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall
27 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393

HB1712
1 be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated
2 by the Commission.
3 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
4 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the
5 Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law
6 in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission
7 shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes
8 law in that State.
9 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a
10 statute repealing the same.
11 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until 180
12 days after enactment of the repealing statute.
13 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
14 withdrawing State’s Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and
15 Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective
16 date of withdrawal.
17 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
18 compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all
19 Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
20 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize
21 all licenses granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after
22 the date of such notice of withdrawal.
23 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate
24 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a
25 Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the
26 provisions of this Compact.
27 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to
28 this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until
29 it is enacted into the laws of all Member States.
30
31 SECTION 15. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
32 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
33 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation
34 and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly
35 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to
36 limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
28 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393

HB1712
1 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
2 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a court of
3 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
4 State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States,
5 or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or
6 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
7 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the
8 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance
9 shall not be affected thereby.
10 C. Notwithstanding subsection B. of this section, the Commission may
11 deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the
12 requirements of Section 13.B., terminate a Member State’s participation in
13 the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member
14 State is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact
15 shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the
16 Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member
17 States and in full force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all
18 severable matters.
19
20 SECTION 16. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
21 A. A Licensee providing services in a Remote State under a Multistate
22 Authorization to Practice shall adhere to the laws and regulations, including
23 laws, regulations, and applicable standards, of the Remote State where the
24 client is located at the time care is rendered.
25 B. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any
26 other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
27 C. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
28 Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the
29 conflict.
30 D. All permissible agreements between the Commission and the Member
31 States are binding in accordance with their terms.
32
33 17-103-402. Administration of compact.
34 (a) The Arkansas Social Work Licensing Board is the Social Work
35 Licensure Compact administrator for this state.
36 (b) The board may adopt rules that are consistent with the Social Work
29 03/07/2025 3:25:10 PM JMB393

HB1712
1 Licensure Compact necessary to implement this subchapter.
2 (c) The board is not required to adopt the rules of the Social Work
3 Licensure Compact Commission for those rules to be effective in this state.

5 under Section 12(D) of the Social Work Licensure Compact, Arkansas delegates
6 its authority in this provision to the General Assembly or the Legislative
7 Council.
