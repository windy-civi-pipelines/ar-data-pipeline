1 (B) Studies of and expertise in the feasibilities of
2 various nuclear reactor technologies and designs;
3 (C) Nuclear reactor licensing, regulation, and law; and
4 (D) Nuclear reactor siting; and
5 (5) Be neutral with regard to reactor technology and designs.
6 (c) Preference shall be given to a consulting firm that is managed by
7 and owned in substantial part by military veterans with nuclear operating
8 experience from the military veterans' time in military service.
9 (d) The feasibility study shall determine:

11 generation in this state, including without limitation the economic and
12 environmental impact;
13 (2) Conclusions and recommendations on:
14 (A) Optimal design specifications based on site
15 characteristics, possible industrial uses, and reactor technology maturity;
16 (B) Land and siting criteria, including specific areas
17 such as data centers, existing energy facilities, military bases, and
18 industrial activities requiring process heat that are best suited for new
19 nuclear generation;
20 (C) Safety criteria required;
21 (D) Engineering services required;
22 (E) The feasibility of implementing all commercially
23 licensable and available nuclear generation technologies, including small
24 modular nuclear reactors and microreactors;
25 (F) Criteria for how well the technologies under
26 subdivision (d)(2)(E) of this section are tested and if there are any cases
27 of successful research or commercial operation of the technologies; and
28 (G) Site transportation and electric transmission
29 capabilities;
30 (3) Socioeconomic assessment and impact analysis, including without
31 limitation consideration of the impact on:
32 (A) Workforce education, training, and development;

2 state;
3 (5) Literature review of studies that have assessed the
4 potential impact of nuclear energy generation in supporting an energy
5 transition;
6 (6) Current and future policies that may be needed to support or
7 accelerate the adoption of nuclear energy generation or may improve its cost-
8 effectiveness, including a survey of federal programs and other methods that
9 could financially assist a nuclear project in this state; and
10 (7) Through an evaluation by a third party, the technical
11 accuracy and independence of the written report under subsection (f) of this
12 section.
13 (e)(1) The consulting firm hired under subsection (a) of this section
14 shall engage and consult with the Department of Energy and Environment, the
15 investor-owned electric utilities, and the electric generation and
16 transmission cooperatives in conducting the feasibility study.
17 (2) The Department of Energy and Environment, the investor-owned
18 electric utilities, and the electric generation and transmission cooperatives
19 shall cooperate in providing information to the consulting firm hired under
20 subsection (a) of this section that is conducting the feasibility study as
21 needed, subject to notification to the investor-owned electric utilities, and
22 the electric generation and transmission cooperatives and reasonable
23 safeguards under applicable state law, including without limitation ยง 23-2-
24 316, to protect confidential information from being disclosed and made
25 public.
26 (3) The consulting firm hired under subsection (a) of this
27 section shall engage and consult with the Department of Energy and the
28 Environment, the investor-owned electric utilities, the electric generation
29 and transmission cooperative, and nuclear reactor and generating facility
30 manufacturers in conducting the feasibility study to establish reasonable
31 safeguards under state law to protect intellectual property and design
32 criteria necessary for the study to protect confidential information and
33 intellectual property from public disclosure.
34 (f) No later than fifteen (15) months after the effective date of this act,
35 the department shall deliver a written report on the feasibility study to

10 SECTION 2. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
11 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that there is not a continuous
12 adequate supply of power to Arkansas citizens and businesses; that a
13 technical feasibility study of new nuclear energy generation could provide
14 valuable information as to how to maintain a continuous adequate supply of
15 power to Arkansas citizens and businesses; and that this act is immediately
16 necessary because maintaining a continuous adequate supply of power to
17 Arkansas citizens and businesses is vital. Therefore, an emergency is
18 declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the
19 preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective
20 on:
21 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
22 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
