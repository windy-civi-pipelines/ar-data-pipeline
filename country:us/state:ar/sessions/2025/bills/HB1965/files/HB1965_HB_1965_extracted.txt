22
23 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code Title 15, Chapter 4, is amended to add an
24 additional subchapter to read as follows:
25 Subchapter 40 — Arkansas Healthy Food Retail Act of 2025
26
27 15-4-4001. Title.
28 This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Arkansas
29 Healthy Food Retail Act of 2025".
30
31 15-4-4002. Legislative findings and intent.
32 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
33 (1) When fresh produce and other healthy foods are not readily
34 available or affordable, people, particularly low-income families, children,
35 and the elderly, face serious barriers to eating a healthy diet;
36 (2) Research in Arkansas and the nation shows that residents of
*JLL147*
03/28/2025 11:20:35 AM JLL147
HB1965
1 low-income, minority, and rural communities are most often affected by high
2 rates of obesity and poor access to supermarkets and other healthy food
3 retailers;
4 (3) Obesity, which frequently results from poor diet and
5 physical inactivity, is America's fast-growing cause of disease and death;
6 (4) Arkansas has one of the highest rates of obesity nationwide,
7 putting growing numbers of Arkansas adults and children at risk for
8 developing heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension, certain cancers, and
9 other health problems;
10 (5) Increasing access to retail food outlets that sell fresh
11 fruits and vegetables and other healthy food is an essential strategy for
12 fighting the obesity epidemic and improving health;
13 (6) Studies have shown that people with better access to
14 supermarkets and fresh produce tend to have healthier diets and lower levels
15 of obesity; and
16 (7) Developing quality retail food outlets also creates jobs,
17 expands markets for Arkansas farmers, and supports economic vitality in
18 underserved communities.
19 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Healthy Food
20 Retailer Program established under this subchapter shall:
21 (1) Provide a reliable source of financing for healthy food
22 retailers operating in underserved communities in the state in both rural and
23 urban areas;
24 (2) Increase access to affordable healthy food to improve diets
25 and health;
26 (3) Promote the sale and consumption of fresh produce,
27 particularly fresh produce that is grown in Arkansas; and
28 (4) Support the expansion of economic opportunities in low-
29 income and rural communities.
30
31 15-4-4003. Definitions.
32 As used in this subchapter:
33 (1) "Funding" means grants, loans, or a combination of grants
34 and loans;

36 retailers that sell high-quality, fresh produce at competitive prices to
2 03/28/2025 11:20:35 AM JLL147

2 and farmers' markets; and

4 access to healthy food retailers in a low-income, low-access, or high-poverty
5 area or an area otherwise determined to have serious healthy, nutritional
6 food limitations.
