21 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code ยง 20-34-101(a)(1), concerning independent
22 inspections of modular buildings for code compliance, is amended to read as

As Engrossed: H1/27/25 H1/30/25 HB1205
1 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that existing laws unfairly and
2 unreasonably restrict the number of accreditation bodies that are permitted
3 to provide third-party certification of modular structures in this state;
4 that allowing other qualified and accredited organizations to provide third-
5 party certifications of these structures would be beneficial to the state and
6 decrease costs to consumers; and that this act is immediately necessary
7 because the economic restrictions and limited choices for manufacturers for
8 manufactured and modular structures directly hinder the economy of this state
9 by restricting competition, increasing costs, and adversely impacting
10 economic activity. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act
11 being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health,
12 and safety shall become effective on:
13 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
14 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
15 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
16 bill; or
17 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
18 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
