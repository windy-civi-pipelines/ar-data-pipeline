13 SECTION 10. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
14 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
15 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
16 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
17 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
18 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
19 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
20 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
21 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
22 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
23 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
