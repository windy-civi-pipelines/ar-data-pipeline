19 other official or officials designated by law, shall compare the assessed
20 value of each parcel of real property reappraised or reassessed to the prior
21 year's assessed value. If the assessed value of the parcel increased, then
22 the assessed value of the parcel shall be adjusted pursuant to this section.
23 (b)(1) If the parcel is not a taxpayer's homestead used as the
24 taxpayer's principal place of residence, then for the first assessment

26 be limited to not more than ten percent (10%) of the assessed value of the
27 parcel for the previous year. In each year thereafter the assessed value
28 shall increase by an additional ten percent (10%) of the assessed value of
29 the parcel for the year prior to the first assessment that resulted from
30 reappraisal but shall not exceed the assessed value determined by the
31 reappraisal prior to adjustment under this subsection. For utility and
32 carrier real property, any annual increase in the assessed value of the
33 parcel shall be limited to not more than ten percent (10%) of the assessed
34 value for the previous year.

9 value determined by the reappraisal prior to adjustment under this
10 subsection.
11 (2) This subsection (c) does not apply to newly discovered real
12 property, new construction, or to substantial improvements to real property.

17 purchase or construction or a later assessed value.
18 (B) When a person becomes disabled or reaches sixty-five
19 (65) years of age on or after January 1, 2001, that person's homestead used
20 as the taxpayer's principal place of residence shall thereafter be assessed
21 based on the lower of the assessed value on the person's sixty-fifth
22 birthday, on the date the person becomes disabled or a later assessed value.
23 (C) If a person is disabled or is at least sixty-five (65)
24 years of age and owns a homestead used as the taxpayer's principal place of
25 residence on January 1, 2001, the homestead shall be assessed based on the
26 lower of the assessed value on January 1, 2001 or a later assessed value.
27 (2) Residing in a nursing home shall not disqualify a person
28 from the benefits of this subsection (d).
29 (3) In instances of joint ownership, if one of the owners
30 qualifies under this subsection (d), all owners shall receive the benefits of
31 this amendment.

3 determined at the most recent previous assessment of the real property on or
4 before December 31, 2026, not including any future increases that would have
5 been implemented as the result of a previous county-wide reappraisal, except
6 that:
7 (1) For real property that is sold, transferred, assigned, or
8 otherwise conveyed on or after January 1, 2027, the assessed value of the

11 the taxpayer;
12 (2) For real property that includes new construction or
13 substantial improvements that were completed on or after January 1, 2027, the

3 law, shall compare the assessed value of each parcel of real property to the
4 prior year's assessed value. If assessed value of the parcel increased, then
5 the assessed value of the parcel for the first assessment resulting from
6 reappraisal shall be adjusted by adding one-third (⅓) of the increase to the
7 assessed value of the parcel for the previous year. An additional one-third
8 (⅓) of the increase shall be added in each of the next two (2) years. This
9 adjustment procedure shall not apply to public utility and carrier property.

13
14 SECTION 3. Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 79, § 4, is amended to
15 read as follows:
16 § 4. [Income adjustments — Personal property millage rate — Uniform
17 property tax rate requirement — Reassessment — Rollback adjustments].
18 (a) The General Assembly shall, by law, provide for procedures to be
19 followed with respect to adjusting ad valorem taxes or millage pledged for
20 bonded indebtedness purposes, to assure that the tax or millage levied for
21 bonded indebtedness purposes will, at all times, provide a level of income
22 sufficient to meet the current requirements of all principal, interest,
23 paying agent fees, reserves, and other requirements of the bond indenture.
24 (b) The millage rate levied against taxable personal property and
25 utility and regulated carrier property in each taxing unit in the state shall
26 be equal to the millage rate levied against real property in each taxing unit
27 in the state. Personal property millage rates currently not equal to real
28 estate millage rates shall be reduced to the level of the real estate millage
29 rate; except to the extent necessary to provide a level of income sufficient
30 to meet the current requirements of all principal, interest, paying agent
31 fees, reserves, and other requirements of the bond indenture.
32 (c) The provisions of this section shall not affect or repeal the
33 required uniform rate of ad valorem property tax set forth in Amendment 74.

35 means for reassessing real property and establish the frequency of
36 reassessment. However, reassessment shall occur at least once every five (5)

1 years.
2 (e) Rollback adjustments under Article 16, Section 14 shall be
3 determined after the adjustments are made to assessed value under this
4 Amendment.
5
6 SECTION 4. Arkansas Constitution, Article 16, § 14, is repealed.
7 § 14. Procedure for adjustment of taxes after reappraisal or
8 reassessment of property.
9 (a) Whenever a countywide reappraisal or reassessment of property
10 subject to ad valorem taxes made in accordance with procedures established by
11 the General Assembly shall result in an increase in the aggregate value of
12 taxable real and personal property in any taxing unit in this State of ten
13 percent (10%) or more over the previous year the rate of city or town,
14 county, school district, and community college district taxes levied against
15 the taxable real and personal property of each such taxing unit shall, upon
16 completion of such reappraisal or reassessment, be adjusted or rolled back,
17 by the governing body of the taxing unit, for the year for which levied as
18 provided below. The General Assembly shall, by law, establish the procedures
19 to be followed by a county in making a countywide reappraisal or reassessment
20 of property which will, upon completion, authorize the adjustment or rollback
21 of property tax rates or millage, as authorized hereinabove. The adjustment
22 or rollback of tax rates or millage for the “base year” as hereinafter
23 defined shall be designed to assure that each taxing unit will receive an
24 amount of tax revenue from each tax source no greater than ten percent (10%)
25 above the revenues received during the previous year from each such tax
26 source, adjusted for any lawful tax or millage rate increase or reduction
27 imposed in the manner provided by law for the year for which the tax
28 adjustment or rollback is to be made, and after making the following
29 additional adjustments:
30 (i) by excluding from such calculation the assessed value of,
31 and taxes derived from, tangible personal property assessed in the taxing
32 unit, and all real and tangible personal property of public utilities and
33 regulated carriers assessed in the taxing unit, and
34 (ii) by computing the adjusted or rollback millage rates on the
35 basis of the reassessed taxable real property for the base year that will
36 produce an amount of revenue no greater than ten percent (10%) above the
6 02/10/2025 8:59:03 AM JLL184
HJR1012
1 revenues produced from the assessed value of real property in the taxing unit
2 (after making the aforementioned adjustments for personal properties and
3 properties of public utilities and regulated carriers noted above) from
4 millage rates in effect in the taxing unit during the base year in which the
5 millage adjustment or rollback is to be calculated. Provided, further, that
6 in calculating the amount of adjusted or rollback millage necessary to
7 produce tax revenues no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues
8 received during the previous year, the governing body shall separate from the
9 assessed value of taxable real property of the taxing unit, newly-discovered
10 real property and new construction and improvements to real property, after
11 making the adjustments for personal property or property of public utilities
12 and regulated carriers noted above, and shall compute the millage necessary
13 to produce an amount of revenues equal to, but no greater than the base year
14 revenues of the taxing unit from each millage source. Such taxing unit may
15 elect either to obtain an increase in revenues equal to the amount of
16 revenues that the computed or adjusted rollback millage will produce from
17 newly-discovered real property and new construction and improvements to real
18 property, or if the same be less than ten percent (10%), the governing body
19 of the taxing unit may recompute the millage rate to be charged to produce an
20 amount no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues collected for
21 taxable real property during the base year.
22 Provided, however, that the amount of revenues to be derived from
23 taxable personal property assessed in the taxing unit for the base year,
24 other than personal property taxes to be paid by public utilities and
25 regulated carriers in the manner provided hereinabove, shall be computed at
26 the millage necessary to produce the same dollar amount of revenues derived
27 during the current year in which the base year adjustment or rollback of
28 millage is computed, and the millage necessary to produce the amount of
29 revenues received from personal property taxes received by the taxing unit,
30 for the base year shall be reduced annually as the assessed value of taxable
31 personal property increases until the amount of revenues from personal
32 property taxes, computed on the basis of the current year millage rates will
33 produce an amount of revenues from taxable personal property equal to or
34 greater than received during the base year, and thereafter the millage rates
35 for computing personal property taxes shall be the millage rates levied for
36 the current year.
7 02/10/2025 8:59:03 AM JLL184
HJR1012
1 Provided, however, that the taxes to be paid by public utilities
2 and regulated carriers in the respective taxing units of the several counties
3 of this State during the first five (5) calendar years in which taxes are
4 levied on the taxable real and personal property as reassessed and equalized
5 in each of the respective counties as a part of a statewide reappraisal
6 program, shall be the greater of the following:
7 (1) the amount of taxes paid on property owned by such
8 public utilities or regulated carriers in or assigned to such taxing unit,
9 less adjustments for properties disposed of or reductions in the assessed
10 valuation of such properties in the base year as defined below, or
11 (2) the amount of taxes due on the assessed valuation of
12 taxable real and tangible personal property belonging to the public utilities
13 or regulated carriers located in or assigned to the taxing unit in each
14 county at millage rates levied for the current year.
15 As used herein, the term “base year” shall mean the year in which
16 a county completes reassessment and equalization of taxable real and personal
17 property as a part of a statewide reappraisal program, and extends the
18 adjusted or rolled back millage rates for the first time, as provided in
19 subsection (a) of this Section, for the respective taxing units in such
20 county for collection in the following year.
21 (i) in the event the amount of taxes paid the taxing unit in a
22 county in the base year, as defined herein, is greater than the taxes due to
23 be paid to such taxing unit for the current year of any year of the second
24 (2nd) period of five (5) years after the base year, the difference between
25 the base year taxes and the current year taxes for any year of such five (5)
26 year period shall be adjusted as follows:
27
28 Current year of second period of (5) years Taxes shall be current year
29 taxes to which shall be added
30 the following percentage of
31 the difference between the
32 current year taxes and the
33 base year taxes (if greater
34 than current year taxes)
35
36 1st year 80% of difference
8 02/10/2025 8:59:03 AM JLL184
HJR1012
1 2nd year 60% of difference
2 3rd year 40% of difference
3 4th year 20% of difference
4 5th year and thereafter Current years taxes only.
5
6 (ii) if the current year taxes of a public utility or regulated
7 carrier equal or exceed the base years taxes due a taxing unit during any
8 year of the first ten (10) years after the base year, the amount of taxes to
9 be paid to such taxing unit shall thereafter be the current years taxes and
10 the adjustment authorized herein shall no longer apply in computing taxes to
11 be paid to such taxing unit.
12 Provided, that in the event the aforementioned requirement for
13 payment of taxes by public utilities and regulated carriers, or any class of
14 utilities or carriers for the ten (10) year period noted above, shall be held
15 by court decision to be contrary to the constitution or statutes of this
16 State or of the Federal Government, the General Assembly may provide for
17 other utilities or classes of carriers to receive the same treatment provided
18 or required under the court order, if deemed necessary to promote equity
19 between similar utilities or classes of carriers.
20 (b) The General Assembly shall, by law, provide for procedures to be
21 followed with respect to adjusting ad valorem taxes or millage pledged for
22 bonded indebtedness purposes, to assure that the adjusted or rolled-back rate
23 of tax or millage levied for bonded indebtedness purposes will, at all times,
24 provide a level of income sufficient to meet the current requirements of all
25 principal, interest, paying agent fees, reserves, and other requirements of
26 the bond indenture. [Added by Const. Amend. 59.]

28 SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. This amendment shall be effective for

3 determined at the most recent previous assessment of the real property on or
4 before December 31, 2026, not including any future increases that would have
5 been implemented as the result of a previous county-wide reappraisal, except
6 that:

28 exception].
29 (a)(1) Section 1 of this Amendment shall not be applicable to a county
30 in which there has been no county-wide reappraisal, as defined by law, and

1 by them.
2 (b) The county assessor, or other official or officials designated by
3 law, shall compare the assessed value of each parcel of real property to the
4 prior year's assessed value. If assessed value of the parcel increased, then
5 the assessed value of the parcel for the first assessment resulting from
6 reappraisal shall be adjusted by adding one-third (⅓) of the increase to the
7 assessed value of the parcel for the previous year. An additional one-third
8 (⅓) of the increase shall be added in each of the next two (2) years. This
9 adjustment procedure shall not apply to public utility and carrier property.

13
14 SECTION 3. Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 79, § 4, is amended to
15 read as follows:
16 § 4. [Income adjustments — Personal property millage rate — Uniform
17 property tax rate requirement — Reassessment — Rollback adjustments].
18 (a) The General Assembly shall, by law, provide for procedures to be
19 followed with respect to adjusting ad valorem taxes or millage pledged for
20 bonded indebtedness purposes, to assure that the tax or millage levied for
21 bonded indebtedness purposes will, at all times, provide a level of income
22 sufficient to meet the current requirements of all principal, interest,
23 paying agent fees, reserves, and other requirements of the bond indenture.
24 (b) The millage rate levied against taxable personal property and
25 utility and regulated carrier property in each taxing unit in the state shall
26 be equal to the millage rate levied against real property in each taxing unit
27 in the state. Personal property millage rates currently not equal to real
28 estate millage rates shall be reduced to the level of the real estate millage
29 rate; except to the extent necessary to provide a level of income sufficient
30 to meet the current requirements of all principal, interest, paying agent
31 fees, reserves, and other requirements of the bond indenture.
32 (c) The provisions of this section shall not affect or repeal the
33 required uniform rate of ad valorem property tax set forth in Amendment 74.
34 (d) The General Assembly may shall, by law, prescribe the method and
35 means for reassessing real property and establish the frequency of
36 reassessment. However, reassessment shall occur at least once every five (5)

1 years.
2 (e) Rollback adjustments under Article 16, Section 14 shall be
3 determined after the adjustments are made to assessed value under this
4 Amendment.
5
6 SECTION 4. Arkansas Constitution, Article 16, § 14, is repealed.
7 § 14. Procedure for adjustment of taxes after reappraisal or
8 reassessment of property.
9 (a) Whenever a countywide reappraisal or reassessment of property
10 subject to ad valorem taxes made in accordance with procedures established by
11 the General Assembly shall result in an increase in the aggregate value of
12 taxable real and personal property in any taxing unit in this State of ten
13 percent (10%) or more over the previous year the rate of city or town,
14 county, school district, and community college district taxes levied against
15 the taxable real and personal property of each such taxing unit shall, upon
16 completion of such reappraisal or reassessment, be adjusted or rolled back,
17 by the governing body of the taxing unit, for the year for which levied as
18 provided below. The General Assembly shall, by law, establish the procedures
19 to be followed by a county in making a countywide reappraisal or reassessment
20 of property which will, upon completion, authorize the adjustment or rollback
21 of property tax rates or millage, as authorized hereinabove. The adjustment
22 or rollback of tax rates or millage for the “base year” as hereinafter
23 defined shall be designed to assure that each taxing unit will receive an
24 amount of tax revenue from each tax source no greater than ten percent (10%)
25 above the revenues received during the previous year from each such tax
26 source, adjusted for any lawful tax or millage rate increase or reduction
27 imposed in the manner provided by law for the year for which the tax
28 adjustment or rollback is to be made, and after making the following
29 additional adjustments:
30 (i) by excluding from such calculation the assessed value of,
31 and taxes derived from, tangible personal property assessed in the taxing
32 unit, and all real and tangible personal property of public utilities and
33 regulated carriers assessed in the taxing unit, and
34 (ii) by computing the adjusted or rollback millage rates on the
35 basis of the reassessed taxable real property for the base year that will
36 produce an amount of revenue no greater than ten percent (10%) above the
6 02/10/2025 8:59:03 AM JLL184

HJR1012
1 revenues produced from the assessed value of real property in the taxing unit
2 (after making the aforementioned adjustments for personal properties and
3 properties of public utilities and regulated carriers noted above) from
4 millage rates in effect in the taxing unit during the base year in which the
5 millage adjustment or rollback is to be calculated. Provided, further, that
6 in calculating the amount of adjusted or rollback millage necessary to
7 produce tax revenues no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues
8 received during the previous year, the governing body shall separate from the
9 assessed value of taxable real property of the taxing unit, newly-discovered
10 real property and new construction and improvements to real property, after
11 making the adjustments for personal property or property of public utilities
12 and regulated carriers noted above, and shall compute the millage necessary
13 to produce an amount of revenues equal to, but no greater than the base year
14 revenues of the taxing unit from each millage source. Such taxing unit may
15 elect either to obtain an increase in revenues equal to the amount of
16 revenues that the computed or adjusted rollback millage will produce from
17 newly-discovered real property and new construction and improvements to real
18 property, or if the same be less than ten percent (10%), the governing body
19 of the taxing unit may recompute the millage rate to be charged to produce an
20 amount no greater than ten percent (10%) above the revenues collected for
21 taxable real property during the base year.
22 Provided, however, that the amount of revenues to be derived from
23 taxable personal property assessed in the taxing unit for the base year,
24 other than personal property taxes to be paid by public utilities and
25 regulated carriers in the manner provided hereinabove, shall be computed at
26 the millage necessary to produce the same dollar amount of revenues derived
27 during the current year in which the base year adjustment or rollback of
28 millage is computed, and the millage necessary to produce the amount of
29 revenues received from personal property taxes received by the taxing unit,
30 for the base year shall be reduced annually as the assessed value of taxable
31 personal property increases until the amount of revenues from personal
32 property taxes, computed on the basis of the current year millage rates will
33 produce an amount of revenues from taxable personal property equal to or
34 greater than received during the base year, and thereafter the millage rates
35 for computing personal property taxes shall be the millage rates levied for
36 the current year.

HJR1012
1 Provided, however, that the taxes to be paid by public utilities
2 and regulated carriers in the respective taxing units of the several counties
3 of this State during the first five (5) calendar years in which taxes are
4 levied on the taxable real and personal property as reassessed and equalized
5 in each of the respective counties as a part of a statewide reappraisal
6 program, shall be the greater of the following:
7 (1) the amount of taxes paid on property owned by such
8 public utilities or regulated carriers in or assigned to such taxing unit,
9 less adjustments for properties disposed of or reductions in the assessed
10 valuation of such properties in the base year as defined below, or
11 (2) the amount of taxes due on the assessed valuation of
12 taxable real and tangible personal property belonging to the public utilities
13 or regulated carriers located in or assigned to the taxing unit in each
14 county at millage rates levied for the current year.
15 As used herein, the term “base year” shall mean the year in which
16 a county completes reassessment and equalization of taxable real and personal
17 property as a part of a statewide reappraisal program, and extends the
18 adjusted or rolled back millage rates for the first time, as provided in
19 subsection (a) of this Section, for the respective taxing units in such
20 county for collection in the following year.
21 (i) in the event the amount of taxes paid the taxing unit in a
22 county in the base year, as defined herein, is greater than the taxes due to
23 be paid to such taxing unit for the current year of any year of the second
24 (2nd) period of five (5) years after the base year, the difference between
25 the base year taxes and the current year taxes for any year of such five (5)
26 year period shall be adjusted as follows:
27
28 Current year of second period of (5) years Taxes shall be current year
29 taxes to which shall be added
30 the following percentage of
31 the difference between the
32 current year taxes and the
33 base year taxes (if greater
34 than current year taxes)
35
36 1st year 80% of difference
8 02/10/2025 8:59:03 AM JLL184

HJR1012
1 2nd year 60% of difference
2 3rd year 40% of difference
3 4th year 20% of difference
4 5th year and thereafter Current years taxes only.
5
6 (ii) if the current year taxes of a public utility or regulated
7 carrier equal or exceed the base years taxes due a taxing unit during any
8 year of the first ten (10) years after the base year, the amount of taxes to
9 be paid to such taxing unit shall thereafter be the current years taxes and
10 the adjustment authorized herein shall no longer apply in computing taxes to
11 be paid to such taxing unit.
12 Provided, that in the event the aforementioned requirement for
13 payment of taxes by public utilities and regulated carriers, or any class of
14 utilities or carriers for the ten (10) year period noted above, shall be held
15 by court decision to be contrary to the constitution or statutes of this
16 State or of the Federal Government, the General Assembly may provide for
17 other utilities or classes of carriers to receive the same treatment provided
18 or required under the court order, if deemed necessary to promote equity
19 between similar utilities or classes of carriers.
20 (b) The General Assembly shall, by law, provide for procedures to be
21 followed with respect to adjusting ad valorem taxes or millage pledged for
22 bonded indebtedness purposes, to assure that the adjusted or rolled-back rate
23 of tax or millage levied for bonded indebtedness purposes will, at all times,
24 provide a level of income sufficient to meet the current requirements of all
25 principal, interest, paying agent fees, reserves, and other requirements of
26 the bond indenture. [Added by Const. Amend. 59.]
27
28 SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE. This amendment shall be effective for
29 assessment years beginning on and after January 1, 2027.
