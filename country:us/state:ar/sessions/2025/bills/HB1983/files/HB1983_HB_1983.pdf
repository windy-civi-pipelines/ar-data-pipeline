21 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS:
22
23 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
24 (a) The General Assembly finds:
25 (1) By Acts 1973, No. 167, the General Assembly authorized the
26 Board of Trustees of the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium at Booneville to
27 sell and convey to Westark Area Council, Inc., Boy Scouts of America, not
28 more than two thousand eight hundred forty-two (2,842) acres of surplus
29 lands, conditioned upon certain restrictive uses and related rights of
30 reverter recited in Acts 1973, No. 167;
31 (2) The sale and conveyance under Acts 1973, No. 167, was
32 accomplished by deed dated June 30, 1973, and recorded with the Circuit Clerk
33 of Logan County, Arkansas, on February 18, 1976, at Miscellaneous Deed Book
34 79, page 534, with the deed incorporating by reference all of the restrictive
35 uses and related rights of reverter prescribed by Acts 1973, No. 167;
36 (3) By Acts 1991, No. 38, the General Assembly sought to confirm

HB1983
1 the earlier conveyance, noting in its legislative intent that as a result
2 of a survey, an ambiguity may exist regarding the subject matter of Acts
3 1973, No. 167, and to “preempt any questions which may arise regarding the
4 subject matter of Act 167 of 1973 such that the Westark Area Council, Inc.,
5 of the Boy Scouts of America may forever be free from any danger, however
6 remote, of a hostile claim,” authorized the Developmental Disabilities
7 Services Board to execute a quitclaim deed in favor of Westark Area Council,
8 Inc., of the Boy Scouts of America;
9 (4) The quitclaim deed under Acts 1991, No. 38, was executed on
10 September 19, 1991, and recorded with the Circuit Clerk of Logan County on
11 October 17, 1991;
12 (5) Despite the intentions expressed by Acts 1991, No. 38,
13 reasonable concern for hostile claims against the Westark Area Council, Inc.,
14 of the Boy Scouts of America arising from these acts and deeds continues to
15 exist as follows:
16 (A) The quitclaim deed related to Acts 1973, No. 167,
17 recites two thousand eight hundred fifty-two (2,852) acres, being ten (10)
18 more acres than the legal description in Acts 1973, No. 167 and Acts 1991,
19 No. 38;
20 (B) There is uncertainty as to whether the Developmental
21 Disabilities Services Board was the full and apt successor in interest to the
22 Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium with authority to release by quitclaim deed
23 any additional real property, or the original conditions of use or rights of
24 reverter, which the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium retained by virtue of
25 Acts 1973, No. 167; and
26 (C) There is uncertainty whether Acts 1991, No. 38, based
27 on resolving ambiguities arising from a survey, intended or had the effect of
28 releasing conditions of use and rights of reverter unrelated to any survey;
29 (6) Westark Area Council, Inc., of the Boy Scouts of America, by
30 Articles of Merger duly filed with the Secretary of State and effective
31 November 16, 2023, merged into and with Quapaw Area Council Incorporated of
32 the Boy Scouts of America, creating as successor in interest to Westark Area
33 Council, Inc., of the Boy Scouts of America, the Natural State Council of Boy
34 Scouts of America, Inc.; and
35 (7) While the land subject to Acts 1973, No. 167 and Acts 1991,
36 No. 38 has excess acreage beyond what is necessary to maintain a safe and
2 04/03/2025 1:16:48 PM MBM207

HB1983
1 appropriate facility for Boy Scout camping and activities, the Natural State
2 Council of Boy Scouts of America, Inc., has expressed that any plan for the
3 future of the land includes reserving and maintaining appropriate land and
4 facilities to be retained in perpetuity for Boy Scout camping, training, and
5 other scouting activities.
6 (b) It is the intent of this act to clarify and confirm absolute and
7 sole title to the subject property, as described in the 1991 quitlcaim deed,
8 in Westark Area Council, Inc., of the Boy Scouts of America, specifically
9 free and clear of any and all conditions or restrictive uses or rights of
10 reverter in favor of the State of Arkansas or any of its agencies or
11 instrumentalities with the exception of Lot 9 and Lot 10 of the Southwest
12 Quarter of Section 31, Township 5, Range 28 West, Logan County, Arkansas and
13 the Southwest Quarter of the Southeast Quarter, Section 31, Township 5 North,
14 Range 28 West, Logan County, Arkansas, and those portions of Lots 1 and 3 of
15 the Fractional Northeast Quarter and of Lots 1 and 2 of the Fractional
16 Northwest Quarter, lying East of Boy Scout Road and West of an unnamed road
17 running North and South within the Fractional Northeast Quarter, all in
18 Section 1, Township 4 North, Range 29 West, which shall be used in connection
19 with boy scouts programs benefiting boy scouts throughout Arkansas, girl
20 scouts and other proposed youth recreational activities, or for partial or
21 controlled use under agreement with the Arkansas State Game and Fish
22 Commission and other public agencies where the use for public purposes will
23 not impair the uses by the Boy Scouts for scouts and youth recreational
24 purposes.
25

27 property to the Westark Area Council, Inc., Boy Scouts of America, is amended
28 to read as follows:

13 option to purchase is exercised by the Boy Scouts, any amounts paid as lease
14 rental shall be applied against the purchase price of the land. The term
