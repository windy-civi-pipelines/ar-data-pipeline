8 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
9 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
10 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
11 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
12 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
13 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
14 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
15 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
