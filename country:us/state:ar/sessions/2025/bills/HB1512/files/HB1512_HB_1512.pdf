56 03-12-2025 10:50:08 CRH113

As Engrossed: H3/6/25 H3/12/25 HB1512
1 equal protection of the law;
2 (3) Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 promotes the
3 desegregation of public schools and authorizes the United States Attorney
4 General to file lawsuits to enforce the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of
5 1964. It defines "desegregation" as "the assignment of students to public
6 schools and within such schools without regard to their race, color,
7 religion, or national origin," thereby removing government-sanctioned racial
8 discrimination in schools and implementing the United States Supreme Court’s
9 holding in "Brown v. Board of Education", 347 U.S. 483 (1954), that racial
10 separation is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
11 Amendment; and
12 (4) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that “No
13 person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national
14 origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
15 subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal
16 financial assistance".
