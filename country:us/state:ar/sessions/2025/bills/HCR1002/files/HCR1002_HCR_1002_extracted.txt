14 TO URGE THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS TO
15 PERMANENTLY EXTEND THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS
16 ACT OF 2017.
17
18 WHEREAS, prior to government-mandated economic shutdowns during the
19 coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017
20 spurred steady economic expansion and allowed the spirit of entrepreneurship
21 to flourish, while creating new jobs and opportunities for millions of
22 Americans; and
23
24 WHEREAS, the tax cuts of 2017 resulted in a one trillion five hundred
25 billion dollar ($1,500,000,000,000) net tax cut, and were followed by
26 historically low unemployment rates, an increase in business investment, and
27 a six thousand dollar ($6,000) increase in real median household income over
28 two years, including scores of raises and bonuses for workers immediately
29 after the 2017 tax cuts were adopted; and
30
31 WHEREAS, more than one hundred million (100,000,000) American taxpayers
32 from all income groups, but especially middle and working class American
33 taxpayers, have enjoyed real tax relief due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of
34 2017; and
35
36 WHEREAS, twenty-three (23) provisions of the 2017 tax cuts directly
*JLL040*
11/20/2024 7:42:23 AM JLL040
HCR1002
1 relating to individual income taxes, such as the reductions in personal
2 income tax rates, the near doubling of the standard deduction, and the
3 substantial reduction of the hated Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), will expire
4 after December 31, 2025; and
5
6 WHEREAS, the 2017 tax cuts reduced federal tax rates for households
7 across every income level, and this relief resulted in a tax cut of more than
8 one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) for the average middle-income
9 earner; and
10
11 WHEREAS, prior to the 2017 tax cuts, the top corporate income tax rate
12 in the United States was thirty-five percent (35%), the highest among all
13 nations in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD);
14 and
15
16 WHEREAS, the 2017 tax cuts reduced the business tax rate from thirty-
17 five percent (35%) to twenty-one percent (21%), bringing the United States
18 back to average among OECD member nations, and dramatically enhancing
19 American competitiveness; and
20
21 WHEREAS, the 2017 tax cuts set an annual cap of ten thousand dollars
22 ($10,000) on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, thereby broadening the
23 tax base at the federal level and in many states, which caused state level
24 budget surpluses and resulted in many states offering substantial tax relief;
25 and
26
27 WHEREAS, if the current ten thousand dollars ($10,000) cap on the SALT
28 deduction is allowed to expire after December 31, 2025, the federal tax base
29 will be narrowed; and
30
31 WHEREAS, returning to an unlimited SALT deduction would be an incentive
32 for many states to once again implement higher taxes and spend at higher
33 levels; and
34
35 WHEREAS, a majority of Americans support making the 2017 tax cuts
36 permanent; and

2 WHEREAS, allowing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to expire would
3 result in a massive tax increase on hardworking American taxpayers, a
4 significant decline in American competitiveness, fewer jobs, reduced wage
5 income for workers, and higher prices,

10
11 THAT the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas urges the United

13 commensurate spending cuts to avoid increasing the federal debt burden.
