26 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings — Nonseverability.
27 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
28 (1) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation and funding
29 for a state agency or institution each fiscal year is the prerogative of the
30 General Assembly;
31 (2) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation and funding
32 for a state agency or institution is usually accomplished by delineating the
33 maximum amounts in the appropriation acts for the state agency or
34 institution, authorizing the distribution of unobligated funds, and in the
35 general revenue allocations authorized for each relevant fund and fund
36 account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law, § 19-5-101 et seq.;

1 (3) The Restricted Reserve Fund has established procedures for

8 (b) The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or if the
9 General Assembly is in session the Joint Budget Committee, is not a severable

11 Council or if the General Assembly is in session the Joint Budget Committee,
12 is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, § 19-5-1263
