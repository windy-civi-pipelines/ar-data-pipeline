26 operations of the authority, then the detachment shall not be effective until
27 the authority and the municipality mutually have attempted to agree in

30 the persons or entities to which payment is due.
31 (b) In reaching the agreement required under subsection (a) of this
32 section, an authority and the municipality may engage with and rely on the
33 opinions and reports of legal and financial professionals to ensure that the
34 agreement reached by the authority and the municipality does not diminish the
35 prospects of, or adversely interfere with, expected payments to be received
36 by the persons or entities to which payment is due, and therefore does not
7 01/23/2025 2:52:06 PM ZRC010
SB96
1 unconstitutionally impair the contract between the municipality and the
2 persons or entities to which payment is due.
3 (c)(1) If an authority and a municipality cannot reach an agreement,
4 any taxes or other revenues relating to the operations of the authority shall
5 be collected in the same manner and amounts as if the land had not been
6 detached.
7 (2) However, after a petition for detachment has been filed by
8 the authority, the municipality:
9 (A) Shall not take any action to:
10 (i) Increase the taxes assessed or levied;
11 (ii) Lengthen the maturity date of the debt
12 obligations;
13 (iii) Decrease amounts paid by other persons or
14 entities that are contributing to amounts used by the municipality to pay the
15 debt obligations; or
16 (iv) Reallocate available revenues to the detriment
17 of the authority beyond those in existence as of the date of the filing of
18 the petition with the county court; and
19 (B) As permitted by the documents relating to the debt
20 obligations, shall use or escrow all pledged taxes and revenues to pay off or
21 prepay the debt obligations and shall not use the pledged taxes and revenues
22 for any other purpose.
23 (d)(1) An authority and a municipality shall enter into a payment in
24 lieu of taxes agreement, interlocal cooperative agreement, or similar
25 agreement documenting the agreement reached by the authority and the
26 municipality with respect to any taxes collected or payments made by the
27 authority while debt obligations are outstanding.
28 (2) The agreement required under subdivision (d)(1) of this
29 section shall contain terms and conditions permitting the renegotiation or
30 revision of payments in the event of unforeseen force majeure events,
31 including without limitation a global pandemic or population or retail
32 growth, that significantly modify the facts known or assumptions made in
33 calculating the payments agreed upon.
34 (3) The municipality shall provide the certificates and
35 directions to the Department of Finance and Administration that are necessary
36 to effect the agreement between the authority and the municipality.
8 01/23/2025 2:52:06 PM ZRC010
SB96
1 (e) A municipality may refinance existing debt obligations after an
2 authority has filed a petition for detachment to achieve debt service savings
3 so long as the refinancing does not increase annual debt service payments,
4 extend the maturity date, or increase the aggregate amount of principal due
5 with respect to the debt obligation.
6 (f) Upon the payment in full at maturity or optional redemption, other
7 than in connection with a refunding permitted under subsection (e) of this
8 section, the authority's property and operations shall be released and exempt
9 from future tax collections or payments, as applicable.
10 (g) A municipality shall not initiate litigation alleging impairment
11 of contract if the authority and the municipality have entered into a written
12 agreement under subsection (d) of this section or if the county court has
13 entered an order for detachment under § 14-362-305(e) that is consistent with
14 subsection (c) of this section.
15
16 SECTION 3. DO NOT CODIFY. Retroactivity — Effect.
17 This act applies retroactively to January 1, 2024, and invalidates any
18 petition to detach filed by a regional airport authority under § 14-362-301

22 obligations.
23 (a) If an authority detaches from a municipality that has previously
24 issued and currently has outstanding bonds or other evidences of indebtedness
25 that are secured by or payable from taxes or other revenues relating to the
26 operations of the authority, then the detachment shall not be effective until
27 the authority and the municipality mutually have attempted to agree in
28 writing to a lump-sum payment or recurring or periodic payments in an amount
29 sufficient to avoid impairing the municipality's contractual obligations to
30 the persons or entities to which payment is due.
31 (b) In reaching the agreement required under subsection (a) of this
32 section, an authority and the municipality may engage with and rely on the
33 opinions and reports of legal and financial professionals to ensure that the
34 agreement reached by the authority and the municipality does not diminish the
35 prospects of, or adversely interfere with, expected payments to be received
36 by the persons or entities to which payment is due, and therefore does not
7 01/23/2025 2:52:06 PM ZRC010

SB96
1 unconstitutionally impair the contract between the municipality and the
2 persons or entities to which payment is due.
3 (c)(1) If an authority and a municipality cannot reach an agreement,
4 any taxes or other revenues relating to the operations of the authority shall
5 be collected in the same manner and amounts as if the land had not been
6 detached.
7 (2) However, after a petition for detachment has been filed by
8 the authority, the municipality:
9 (A) Shall not take any action to:
10 (i) Increase the taxes assessed or levied;
11 (ii) Lengthen the maturity date of the debt
12 obligations;
13 (iii) Decrease amounts paid by other persons or
14 entities that are contributing to amounts used by the municipality to pay the
15 debt obligations; or
16 (iv) Reallocate available revenues to the detriment
17 of the authority beyond those in existence as of the date of the filing of
18 the petition with the county court; and
19 (B) As permitted by the documents relating to the debt
20 obligations, shall use or escrow all pledged taxes and revenues to pay off or
21 prepay the debt obligations and shall not use the pledged taxes and revenues
22 for any other purpose.
23 (d)(1) An authority and a municipality shall enter into a payment in
24 lieu of taxes agreement, interlocal cooperative agreement, or similar
25 agreement documenting the agreement reached by the authority and the
26 municipality with respect to any taxes collected or payments made by the
27 authority while debt obligations are outstanding.
28 (2) The agreement required under subdivision (d)(1) of this
29 section shall contain terms and conditions permitting the renegotiation or
30 revision of payments in the event of unforeseen force majeure events,
31 including without limitation a global pandemic or population or retail
32 growth, that significantly modify the facts known or assumptions made in
33 calculating the payments agreed upon.
34 (3) The municipality shall provide the certificates and
35 directions to the Department of Finance and Administration that are necessary
36 to effect the agreement between the authority and the municipality.

1 (e) A municipality may refinance existing debt obligations after an
2 authority has filed a petition for detachment to achieve debt service savings
3 so long as the refinancing does not increase annual debt service payments,
4 extend the maturity date, or increase the aggregate amount of principal due
5 with respect to the debt obligation.
6 (f) Upon the payment in full at maturity or optional redemption, other
7 than in connection with a refunding permitted under subsection (e) of this
8 section, the authority's property and operations shall be released and exempt
9 from future tax collections or payments, as applicable.
10 (g) A municipality shall not initiate litigation alleging impairment
11 of contract if the authority and the municipality have entered into a written
12 agreement under subsection (d) of this section or if the county court has
13 entered an order for detachment under § 14-362-305(e) that is consistent with
14 subsection (c) of this section.

16 SECTION 3. DO NOT CODIFY. Retroactivity — Effect.
