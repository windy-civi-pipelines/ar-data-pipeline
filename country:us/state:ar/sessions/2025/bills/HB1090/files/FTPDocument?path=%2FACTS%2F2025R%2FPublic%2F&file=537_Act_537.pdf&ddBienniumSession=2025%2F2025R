10 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
11 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
12 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
13 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
14 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
15 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
16 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
