6 shall be transferred to the State Central Services Fund, or its successor

27 Property Proceeds Trust Fund to the State Central Services Fund creates a
28 liability that flows from the State Central Services Fund to the Unclaimed
29 Property Proceeds Trust Fund; that this bill would halt the growing liability
30 by segregating the privately owned principal in the Unclaimed Property
31 Proceeds Trust Fund from the state-owned interest derived from the investment
32 of the funds in the Unclaimed Property Proceeds Trust Fund; and that this act
33 is necessary because this act will enable the new Unclaimed Property Interest
34 Trust Fund to build a balance in anticipation of the required reimbursement
35 to the State Central Services Fund, which will reduce the unfunded liability
36 created under current law. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and
