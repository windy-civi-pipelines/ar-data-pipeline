13 (a) In this section:
14 (1) “Determinable charitable interest” means a charitable

24 organization meets the requirement on the date of determination.

26 Attorney General has the rights of a qualified beneficiary and may represent
27 and bind the charitable interest.

HB1749
1 (d) If there are two (2) or more second trusts, the second trusts
2 shall be treated as one trust for purposes of determining whether the
3 exercise of the decanting power diminishes the charitable interest or
4 diminishes the interest of an identified charitable organization for purposes
5 of subsection (c) of this section.
6 (e) If a first trust contains a determinable charitable interest, the
7 second trust or trusts that include a charitable interest pursuant to
8 subsection (c) of this section shall be administered under the law of this
9 state unless the:
10 (1) Attorney General, after receiving notice under § 28-78-107,
11 fails to object in a signed record delivered to the authorized fiduciary
12 within the notice period;

24 part or all of the principal of the trust to another trust or to modify the
25 trust.
26 (b) Exercise of the decanting power is subject to any restriction in
27 the first-trust instrument that expressly applies to exercise of:
28 (1) The decanting power; or
29 (2) A power granted by state law to a fiduciary to distribute
30 part or all of the principal of the trust to another trust or to modify the
31 trust.
32 (c) A general prohibition of the amendment or revocation of a first
33 trust, a spendthrift clause, or a clause restraining the voluntary or
34 involuntary transfer of a beneficiary’s interest does not preclude exercise
35 of the decanting power.
36 (d) Subject to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, an authorized
15 03/11/2025 5:25:18 PM MAG009

HB1749
1 fiduciary may exercise the decanting power under this chapter even if the
2 first-trust instrument permits the authorized fiduciary or another person to
3 modify the first-trust instrument or to distribute part or all of the
4 principal of the first trust to another trust.
5 (e) If a first-trust instrument contains an express prohibition
6 described in subsection (a) of this section or an express restriction

16 the increase in a signed record; or
17 (2) The increase is approved by the court.
18 (b) If a first-trust instrument does not specify an authorized

22 (1) All qualified beneficiaries of the second trust consent to
23 the increase in a signed record; or
24 (2) The increase is approved by the court.
25 (c) A change in an authorized fiduciary’s compensation which is
26 incidental to other changes made by the exercise of the decanting power is
27 not an increase in the fiduciary’s compensation for purposes of subsections
28 (a) and (b) of this section.
29
30 28-78-117. Relief from liability and indemnification.
31 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a second-trust
32 instrument shall not relieve an authorized fiduciary from liability for
33 breach of trust to a greater extent than the first-trust instrument.
34 (b) A second-trust instrument may provide for indemnification of an
35 authorized fiduciary of the first trust or another person acting in a
36 fiduciary capacity under the first trust for any liability or claim that

HB1749
1 would have been payable from the first trust if the decanting power had not
2 been exercised.

12 28-78-118. Removal or replacement of authorized fiduciary.
13 An authorized fiduciary shall not exercise the decanting power to
14 modify a provision in a first-trust instrument granting another person power
15 to remove or replace the fiduciary unless the:
16 (1) Person holding the power consents to the modification in a
17 signed record and the modification applies only to the person;
18 (2) Person holding the power and the qualified beneficiaries of
19 the second trust consent to the modification in a signed record and the
20 modification grants a substantially similar power to another person; or
21 (3) Court approves the modification and the modification grants

12 provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or state law under which the transfer
13 qualified;
14 (2) If the first trust contains property that qualified, or

13 January 1, 2025.
14 (B) If the property of the first trust includes shares of

33 permitted under this chapter is void to the extent necessary to comply with
34 this chapter; and

36 trust instrument which is not contained in the instrument is deemed to be
21 03/11/2025 5:25:18 PM MAG009

1 included in the instrument to the extent necessary to comply with this
2 chapter.
3 (b) If a trustee or other fiduciary of a second trust determines that

19 (c) A protector for an animal has the rights under this chapter of a
20 qualified beneficiary.

10 trust after the exercise of the power is part of the trust estate of the
11 second trust or trusts.
12 (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, if
13 exercise of the decanting power was intended to distribute less than all the
14 principal of the first trust to one or more second trusts, later-discovered

16 first trust after exercise of the power remains part of the trust estate of
