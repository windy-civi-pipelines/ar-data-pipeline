occupational cancer are in need of urgent revision to provide fair and just
treatment to members and the beneficiaries of members who have died in the
line of duty as a result of cancer that occurred as a result of those
members' occupation; and that an effective date of July 1, 2025, is necessary
in order to allow time to allow for a structured and proper administration
and to send educational notices to covered employers of the procedures
referenced in this act. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and
this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health,
and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2025."
