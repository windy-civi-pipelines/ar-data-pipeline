As Engrossed: H2/26/25 HB1322
1 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the provisions of the Arkansas
2 Local Police and Fire Retirement System related to line-of-duty death due to

4 treatment to members and the beneficiaries of members who have died in the
5 line of duty as a result of cancer that occurred as a result of those
6 members' occupation; and that an effective date of July 1, 2025, is necessary
7 in order to allow time to allow for a structured and proper administration
8 and to send educational notices to covered employers of the procedures
9 referenced in this act. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and
10 this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health,
11 and safety shall become effective on July 1, 2025.
