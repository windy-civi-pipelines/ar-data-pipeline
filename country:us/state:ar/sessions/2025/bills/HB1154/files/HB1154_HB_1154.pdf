19 System must be able to meet the needs of its members as anticipated by the
20 General Assembly; that certain provisions of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement
21 System Act, § 24-7-201 et seq., need immediate revision and updating to bring
22 them into conformance with sound public pension policy and actuarial
23 requirements; that the revisions and updates are of great importance to
24 members of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and to other citizens of
25 the State of Arkansas; that as the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System
26 operates on a fiscal year of July 1 to June 30, an effective date of July 1,
27 2025, is necessary in order to allow the provisions within this act to begin
28 on the first day of the fiscal year and to allow for a structured and proper
29 administration of the procedures referenced in this act; that the updates and
30 revisions to the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System Act are of great
31 importance for actuarial purposes and for the improvement and protection of
32 member benefits under the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System; and that this
33 act is necessary in order to maintain an orderly system of benefits for the
34 members of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System. Therefore, an emergency
35 is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the
36 preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective
