6 safety and soundness of the state trust company. The safety and soundness
7 factors to be considered by the commissioner in the exercise of such

18 the commissioner for the same purposes for which it otherwise would be
19 required to be submitted to the Secretary of State and compliance with the
20 applicable provisions of this chapter.
21 (c) The commissioner may adopt rules to limit or refine the
22 applicability of subsection (a) of this section to a trust company or to

5 (3) The exempt private trust company withholds requested
6 information from the commissioner; or
7 (4) The exempt private trust company violates any provision of
8 this section applicable to exempt private trust companies.
9 (e) Notification of Revocation of Exemption. If the commissioner
10 determines from examination or other credible evidence that an exempt private
11 trust company has violated any of the requirements of this section, the
12 commissioner may by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, return
13 receipt requested, notify the exempt private trust company in writing that
14 the private trust company's exempt status has been revoked. The notification
15 must state grounds for the revocation with reasonable certainty. The notice
16 must state its effective date, which may not be sooner than five (5) calendar
17 days after the date the notification is mailed or delivered. The revocation
18 takes effect for the private trust company if the private trust company does
19 not request a hearing in writing before the effective date. After taking
20 effect the revocation is final and nonappealable as to that private trust
21 company, and the private trust company shall be subject to all of the
22 requirements and provisions of the chapter applicable to non-exempt state
23 trust companies.
24 (f) Compliance Period. A private trust company shall have five (5)
25 calendar days after the revocation is effective to comply with the provisions

28 company has been engaging in or attempting to engage in acts intended or
29 designed to deceive or defraud the public, the commissioner may shorten or
30 eliminate, in the commissioner's sole discretion, the five (5) calendar days
31 compliance period.
32 (g) Remedies for Failure to Comply. If the private trust company does
33 not comply with all of the provisions of this chapter, including such
34 capitalization requirements as have been determined by the commissioner as
35 necessary to assure the safety and soundness of the private trust company,
36 within the prescribed time period, the commissioner may:

6 23-51-120. Conversion to public trust company.
7 (a) A private trust company may terminate its status as a private
8 trust company and commence transacting business with the general public. A
9 private trust company desiring to commence transacting business with the
10 general public shall file a notice on a form prescribed by the Bank
11 Commissioner, which shall set forth the name of the private trust company and
12 an acknowledgment that any exemption granted or otherwise applicable to the
13 private trust company pursuant to § 23-51-118 shall cease to apply on the
14 effective date of the notice, furnish a copy of the resolution adopted by the
15 board authorizing the private trust company to commence transacting business
16 with the general public, and pay the filing fee, if any, prescribed by the
17 commissioner.

19 public thirty (30) days after the date the commissioner receives the notice,
20 unless the commissioner specifies another date.
21 (c) The thirty-day period of review may be extended by the
22 commissioner on determination that the written notice raises issues that
23 require additional information or additional time for analysis. If the period
24 for review is extended, the notificant may commence transacting business with
25 the public only on prior written approval by the commissioner.
26 (d) The commissioner may deny approval of the notice of the private
27 trust company to commence transacting business with the general public if the
28 commissioner finds that the notificant lacks sufficient financial resources
29 to undertake the proposed expansion without adversely affecting its safety or
30 soundness or that the proposed transacting of business of the general public
31 would be contrary to the public interest or if the commissioner determines
32 that the notificant will not within a reasonable period be in compliance with
33 any provision of this chapter from which the notificant had been previously
34 exempted pursuant to § 23-51-118.

28 wholly of investments in which the state trust company could invest directly
29 for its own account.

11 trust company for the lesser of the amount by which the loan exceeded
12 applicable lending limits or the state trust company's actual loss and
13 remains liable for that amount until the loan and all prior indebtedness of
14 the borrower to the state trust company have been fully repaid. The state
15 trust company may initiate a proceeding to collect an amount due under this
16 subsection at any time before the date the borrower defaults on the subject
17 loan or any prior indebtedness or before the fourth anniversary of that date.
18 A person that is liable for and pays amounts to the state trust company under
19 this subsection is entitled to an assignment of the state trust company's

5 for purposes of § 23-51-128.

5 combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the trust
6 industry in any part of this state, unless:

21 group comprising the proposed transferee, are insufficient to justify a
22 belief that the state trust company will be free from improper or unlawful
23 influence or interference with respect to the state trust company's operation
24 in compliance with law;

29 competition, be in restraint of trade, or is not in the public interest,
30 unless:
31 (A) The anticompetitive effects of the proposed

11 influence or interference with respect to the state trust company's operation

12 commissioner may by personal delivery or registered or certified mail, return
13 receipt requested, notify the exempt private trust company in writing that
14 the private trust company's exempt status has been revoked. The notification
15 must state grounds for the revocation with reasonable certainty. The notice
16 must state its effective date, which may not be sooner than five (5) calendar
17 days after the date the notification is mailed or delivered. The revocation

21 company, and the private trust company shall be subject to all of the

23 trust companies.
24 (f) Compliance Period. A private trust company shall have five (5)
25 calendar days after the revocation is effective to comply with the provisions

27 commissioner determines, at the time of revocation, that the private trust
28 company has been engaging in or attempting to engage in acts intended or
29 designed to deceive or defraud the public, the commissioner may shorten or
30 eliminate, in the commissioner's sole discretion, the five (5) calendar days
31 compliance period.
32 (g) Remedies for Failure to Comply. If the private trust company does
33 not comply with all of the provisions of this chapter, including such

10 general public shall file a notice on a form prescribed by the Bank
11 Commissioner, which shall set forth the name of the private trust company and
12 an acknowledgment that any exemption granted or otherwise applicable to the
13 private trust company pursuant to § 23-51-118 shall cease to apply on the

19 public thirty (30) days after the date the commissioner receives the notice,
20 unless the commissioner specifies another date.
21 (c) The thirty-day period of review may be extended by the
22 commissioner on determination that the written notice raises issues that
23 require additional information or additional time for analysis. If the period
24 for review is extended, the notificant may commence transacting business with
25 the public only on prior written approval by the commissioner.
26 (d) The commissioner may deny approval of the notice of the private
27 trust company to commence transacting business with the general public if the
28 commissioner finds that the notificant lacks sufficient financial resources
29 to undertake the proposed expansion without adversely affecting its safety or
30 soundness or that the proposed transacting of business of the general public
31 would be contrary to the public interest or if the commissioner determines
32 that the notificant will not within a reasonable period be in compliance with
33 any provision of this chapter from which the notificant had been previously
34 exempted pursuant to § 23-51-118.

5 for purposes of § 23-51-128.

14 shareholder's legal representative, addressed to the shareholder's last known
