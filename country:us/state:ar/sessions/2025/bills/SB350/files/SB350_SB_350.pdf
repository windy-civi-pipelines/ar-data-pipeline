21 LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General Assembly, in the
22 transition to a state-funded Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Task Force system, to
23 provide an appropriate and adequate level of Drug Enforcement Activity
24 through Multi-Jurisdictional Task Forces in all areas of the state. It is
25 recognized by the General Assembly that in many areas of the state resources
26 have not been available to support Drug Enforcement at the necessary level.
27 With the transition of funding of Multi-Jurisdictional Drug Task Forces to
28 state funding; it is not the intent of the General Assembly to adversely
29 affect those districts whose system has been working well or to implement a
30 system which is too inflexible to respond to the needs of each judicial
31 district or task force area. Therefore, the Prosecution Coordination
32 Commission is charged with the responsibility of assisting in the maintenance
33 of a system which equitably serves all areas of the state by providing
34 statewide coordination of drug enforcement with law enforcement agencies
35 statewide.
36 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1,

3 SECTION 10. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
4 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
5 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
6 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
7 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
8 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
9 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
10 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
11 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
12
13 SECTION 11. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
14 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
15 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
16 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
17 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
18 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
19 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
20 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
21
22 SECTION 12. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
23 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
24 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
25 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
26 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
27 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
28 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
29 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
30 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
31 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
32 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
