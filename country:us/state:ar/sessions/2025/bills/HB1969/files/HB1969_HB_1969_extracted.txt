15 or outpatient hospital directed payment access payments required under § 20-

32
33 20-77-2917. Directed payment preprint.

17 04/01/2025 5:48:35 PM JMB373

HB1969
1 directed payment preprint and any information required under 42 C.F.R.§
2 438.6(c) to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services at least ninety (90)

4 (2) The division shall prepare the annual 42 C.F.R. § 438.6(c)
5 directed payment preprint or amendment in collaboration with the Arkansas
6 Hospital Association, Inc.
7 (3) To the extent the directed payment preprint or amendment
8 that the division plans to submit to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid

11 year or directed payment preprint submission, the division shall provide the
12 Medicaid Sustainability Advisory Committee at least thirty (30) days to
13 review and propose an alternative methodology.
14 (4) The division shall use the methodology proposed by the
15 Medicaid Sustainability Advisory Committee for the directed payment preprint
16 submission unless the division obtains written confirmation from the Centers
17 for Medicare & Medicaid Services that the proposed alternative methodology
18 cannot be approved as proposed and that no modifications are possible to
19 obtain approval for the alternative methodology.
20 (5) The division shall make the written confirmation available
21 to the Medicaid Sustainability Advisory Committee.
22 (b)(1) The directed payment preprint shall not condition hospital
23 eligibility for directed payments upon hospital compliance with initiatives
24 and policies that are not related to quality measures identified in the
25 Medicaid managed care quality strategy or otherwise require hospitals to
26 spend a portion of their directed payment or other revenues as prescribed by
27 the division to remain eligible for directed payments.
28 (2) All inpatient and outpatient hospital services paid by
29 contracted entities for services shall be eligible for the directed payment,
30 regardless of whether the hospital is in-network with the contracted entity.
31 (c) If the directed payment preprint is not approved by the Centers
32 for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the division shall:
33 (1) Not implement the hospital directed payment assessment
34 imposed under § 20-77-2904; and
35 (2) Return any hospital directed payment assessment fees to the
36 hospitals that paid the fees if hospital directed payment assessment fees
