20 additional subchapter to read as follows:
21 Subchapter 2 — Physician Assistant Licensure Compact
22
23 17-105-201. Text of compact.
24 The Physician Assistant Licensure Compact is enacted into law and
25 entered into by this state with all states legally joining therein and in the
26 form substantially as follows:
27 PA LICENSURE COMPACT
28
29 Section 1. Purpose
30 In order to strengthen access to Medical Services, and in recognition of the
31 advances in the delivery of Medical Services, the Participating States of the
32 PA Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive
33 process that complements the existing authority of State Licensing Boards to
34 license and discipline PAs and seeks to enhance the portability of a License
35 to practice as a PA while safeguarding the safety of patients. This Compact
36 allows Medical Services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual recognition of
*JMB017*
02-17-2025 11:13:38 JMB017

As Engrossed: S2/17/25 SB101
1 the Licensee’s Qualifying License by other Compact Participating States. This
2 Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for PA licensure and affirms that
3 the practice and delivery of Medical Services by the PA occurs where the
4 patient is located at the time of the patient encounter, and therefore
5 requires the PA to be under the jurisdiction of the State Licensing Board
6 where the patient is located. State Licensing Boards that participate in this
7 Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose Adverse Action against a Compact
8 Privilege in that State issued to a PA through the procedures of this
9 Compact. The PA Licensure Compact will alleviate burdens for military
10 families by allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to
11 obtain a Compact Privilege based on having an unrestricted License in good
12 standing from a Participating State.
13

20 both personally and in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to
21 or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or
22 arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred,
23 or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for
24 believing occurred within the scope of Commission employment, duties or
25 responsibilities; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed
26 to protect any such person from suit or liability for any damage, loss,

5 person’s intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.
6 3. The Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member,

14 intentional or willful or wanton misconduct of that person.
15 4. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the

17 jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is located. The
18 Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses in any proceedings as
19 authorized by Commission Rules.
20 5. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the
21 liability of any Licensee for professional malpractice or misconduct, which
22 shall be governed solely by any other applicable State laws.
23 6. Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the venue or
24 jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of malpractice, professional

30 action affirmative defense with respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman
31 Act, Clayton Act, or any other State or federal antitrust or anticompetitive
32 law or regulation.

9 Commission Rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the
10 Commission for each Rule.
11 B. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to
12 effectively and efficiently implement and administer this Compact and achieve
13 its purposes. A Commission Rule shall be invalid and have not force or effect
14 only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid

22 competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in
23 that State to the extent of the conflict.
24 D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating States
25 rejects a Commission Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the
26 same manner used to adopt this Compact within four (4) years of the date of
27 adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect
28 in any Participating State or to any State applying to participate in the
29 Compact.
30 E. Commission Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting
31 of the Commission.
32 F. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final Rule or Rules by the
33 Commission, and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which
34 the Rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a

24 business days before the scheduled date of the hearing, notify the Commission
25 of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing.
26 2. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person
27 who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or
28 in writing.
29 3. All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording and
30 the written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments received in
31 response to the proposed rulemaking shall be made available to a person upon
32 request.
33 4. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a

12 the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as
13 reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
14 4. The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date
15 for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in subsection L, the
16 effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after the
17 Commission issued the notice that it adopted the Rule.
18 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
19 consider and adopt an emergency Rule with twenty-four (24) hours prior
20 notice, without the opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the
21 usual rulemaking procedures provided in this Compact and in this section
22 shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in
23 no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule.
24 For the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be
25 adopted immediately by the Commission in order to:
26 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
27 2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State funds;
28 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Commission Rule
29 that is established by federal law or Rule; or

32 direct revisions to a previously adopted Commission Rule for purposes of
33 correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or
34 grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the
35 website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any
36 person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be

2 a Rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in the notice of revisions and
3 delivered to the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no
4 challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If
5 the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the
6 approval of the Commission.

8 this Compact.

10 Section 10. Oversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement
11 A. Oversight
12 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
13 each Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
14 necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
15 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the
16 Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent
17 jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is located. The
18 Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it
19 adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
20 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety
21 of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,
22 misconduct or any such similar matter.
23 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
24 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the
25 Compact or the Commission’s Rules and shall have standing to intervene in
26 such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission with
27 service of process shall render a judgment or order in such proceeding void
28 as to the Commission, this Compact, or Commission Rules.
29 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
30 1. If the Commission determines that a Participating State has
31 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
32 this Compact or the Commission Rules, the Commission shall provide written
33 notice to the defaulting State and other Participating States. The notice
34 shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default and any
35 other action that the Commission may take and shall offer remedial training
36 and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
20 02-17-2025 11:13:38 JMB017

As Engrossed: S2/17/25 SB101
1 2. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the
2 defaulting State may be terminated from this Compact upon an affirmative vote
3 of a majority of the delegates of the Participating States, and all rights,
4 privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact upon such State may be
5 terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does
6 not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during
7 the period of default.
8 3. Termination of participation in this Compact shall be imposed
9 only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice
10 of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the
11 governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State’s
12 legislature, and to the Licensing Board(s) of each of the Participating
13 States.

15 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date
16 of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date
17 of termination.

19 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from this Compact,
20 unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting
21 State.
22 6. The defaulting State may appeal its termination from the
23 Compact by the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the
24 District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its
25 principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such
26 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
27 7. Upon the termination of a State’s participation in the
28 Compact, the State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees within
29 that State of such termination:
30 a. Licensees who have been granted a Compact Privilege in
31 that State shall retain the Compact Privilege for one hundred eighty (180)
32 days following the effective date of such termination.
33 b. Licensees who are licensed in that State who have been
34 granted a Compact Privilege in a Participating State shall retain the Compact
35 Privilege for one hundred eighty (180) days unless the Licensee also has a
36 Qualifying License in a Participating State or obtains a Qualifying License

As Engrossed: S2/17/25 SB101
1 in a Participating State before the one hundred eighty (180)-day period ends,
2 in which case the Compact Privilege shall continue.
3 C. Dispute Resolution
4 1. Upon request by a Participating State, the Commission shall
5 attempt to resolve disputes related to this Compact that arise among
6 Participating States and between participating and non-Participating States.
7 2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both
8 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.
9 D. Enforcement
10 1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion,
11 shall enforce the provisions of this Compact and Rules of the Commission.
12 2. If compliance is not secured after all means to secure
13 compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, the Commission may initiate
14 legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
15 or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices,
16 against a Participating State in default to enforce compliance with the
17 provisions of this Compact and the Commission’s promulgated Rules and bylaws.
18 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the
19 event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
20 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
21 3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of
22 the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under
23 federal or State law.
24 E. Legal Action Against the Commission
25 1. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the
26 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
27 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce
28 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its Rules. The relief
29 sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial
30 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of
31 such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
32 2. No person other than a Participating State shall enforce this
33 Compact against the Commission.
34
35 Section 11. Date of Implementation of the PA Licensure Compact Commission

22 02-17-2025 11:13:38 JMB017

As Engrossed: S2/17/25 SB101
1 Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Participating State.
2 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Commission
3 shall convene and review the enactment of each of the States that enacted the
4 Compact prior to the Commission convening (“Charter Participating States”) to
5 determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter Participating State is
6 materially different than the Model Compact.
7 a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment is found
8 to be materially different from the Model Compact shall be entitled to the
9 default process set forth in Section 10.B.
10 b. If any Participating State later withdraws from the
11 Compact or its participation is terminated, the Commission shall remain in
12 existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number of
13 Participating States should be less than seven. Participating States enacting
14 the Compact subsequent to the Commission convening shall be subject to the
15 process set forth in Section 7.C.21 to determine if their enactments are
16 materially different from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for
17 participation in the Compact.
18 2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the
19 seven initial Charter Participating States shall be subject to the process
20 set forth in Section 7.C.21 to determine if their enactments are materially
21 different from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for participation
22 in the Compact.
23 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
24 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the
25 effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall
26 be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated
27 by the Commission.
28 B. Any State that joins this Compact shall be subject to the
29 Commission’s Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which this Compact
30 becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the
31 Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day this
32 Compact becomes law in that State.
33 C. Any Participating State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting
34 a statute repealing the same.
35 1. A Participating State’s withdrawal shall not take effect
36 until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the repealing statute.

1 During this one hundred eighty (180) day-period, all Compact Privileges that
2 were in effect in the withdrawing State and were granted to Licensees
3 licensed in the withdrawing State shall remain in effect. If any Licensee
4 licensed in the withdrawing State is also licensed in another Participating
5 State or obtains a license in another Participating State within the one
6 hundred eighty (180) days, the Licensee’s Compact Privileges in other
7 Participating States shall not be affected by the passage of the one hundred
8 eighty (180) days.
9 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
10 State Licensing Board(s) of the withdrawing State to comply with the
11 investigative, and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact
12 prior to the effective date of withdrawal.
13 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a State from this
14 Compact, the State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all
15 Licensees within that State. Such withdrawing State shall continue to
16 recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of one
17 hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
18 D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate
19 or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement
20 between Participating States and between a Participating State and non-
21 Participating State that does not conflict with the provisions of this
22 Compact.
23 E. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States. No
24 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any
25 Participating State until it is enacted materially in the same manner into
26 the laws of all Participating States as determined by the Commission.
27
28 Section 12. Construction and Severability
29 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
30 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation
31 and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly
32 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to
33 limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
34 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
35 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a court of
36 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any

As Engrossed: S2/17/25 SB101
1 Participating State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the
2 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person
3 or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
4 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the
5 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance
6 shall not be affected thereby.
7 C. Notwithstanding subsection B or this section, the Commission may
8 deny a State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the
9 requirements of Section 10.B, terminate a Participating State’s participation
10 in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a
11 Participating State is, or would be with respect to a State seeking to
12 participate in the Compact, a material departure from the Compact.
13 Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution
14 of any Participating State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect
15 as to the remaining Participating States and in full force and effect as to
16 the Participating State affected as to all severable matters.
17
18 Section 13. Binding Effect of Compact
19 A. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a
20 Participating State that is not inconsistent with this Compact.
21 B. Any laws in a Participating State in conflict with this Compact are
22 superseded to the extent of the conflict.
23 C. All agreements between the Commission and the Participating States
