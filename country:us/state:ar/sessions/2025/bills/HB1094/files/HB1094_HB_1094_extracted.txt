13 provided by this act.

19 OF APPROPRIATIONS. In the event the amount of any of the budget
20 classifications of maintenance and general operation in this act are found by
21 the administrative head of the agency to be inadequate, then the agency head
22 may request, upon forms provided for such purpose by the Chief Fiscal Officer
23 of the State, a modification of the amounts of the budget classification. In
24 that event, he shall set out on the forms the particular classifications for
25 which he is requesting an increase or decrease, the amounts thereof, and his
26 reasons therefor. In no event shall the total amount of the budget exceed
27 either the amount of the appropriation or the amount of the funds available,
28 nor shall any transfer be made from the capital outlay or data processing
29 subclassifications unless specific authority for such transfers is provided
30 by law, except for transfers from capital outlay to data processing when
31 determined by the Department of Transformation & Shared Services - Division
32 of Information Systems that data processing services for a state agency can
33 be performed on a more cost-efficient basis by the Department of
34 Transformation & Shared Services - Division of Information Systems than
35 through the purchase of data processing equipment by that state agency. In
36 considering the proposed modification as prepared and submitted by each state

HB1094
1 agency, the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall make such studies as he
2 deems necessary. The Chief Fiscal Officer of the State shall, after obtaining
3 the approval of the Legislative Council, approve the requested transfer if in
4 his opinion it is in the best interest of the state.
5 The General Assembly has determined that the agency in this act could be
6 operated more efficiently if some flexibility is given to that agency and
7 that flexibility is being accomplished by providing authority to transfer
8 between certain items of appropriation made by this act. Since the General
9 Assembly has granted the agency broad powers under the transfer of
10 appropriations, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
11 Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the transfers by requiring
12 prior approval of the Legislative Council in the utilization of the transfer
13 authority. Therefore, the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council
14 is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of approval by
15 the Legislative Council is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent
16 jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
17 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
18 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

20 SECTION 6. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS

22 POSITIONS. (a) Nothing in this act shall be construed as a commitment of the
23 State of Arkansas or any of its agencies or institutions to continue funding
24 any position paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement in the event
25 that Tobacco Settlement funds are not sufficient to finance the position.
26 (b) State funds will not be used to replace Tobacco Settlement funds when
27 such funds expire, unless appropriated by the General Assembly and authorized
28 by the Governor.
29 (c) A disclosure of the language contained in (a) and (b) of this Section
30 shall be made available to all new hire and current positions paid from the
31 proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement by the Tobacco Settlement Commission.
32 (d) Whenever applicable the information contained in (a) and (b) of this
33 section shall be included in the employee handbook and/or Professional
34 Services Contract paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement.
35 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024

7 Cancer Control Fund in order to provide for the State's matching share for
8 Medicaid services provided for breast and cervical cancer screening and
9 treatment. The amount transferred annually shall be the only obligation of
10 the Arkansas Department of Health for state match for these services.
11 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024

16 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds authorized by this act
17 shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency and funds made
18 available by law for the support of such appropriations; and the restrictions
19 of the State Purchasing Law, the General Accounting and Budgetary Procedures
20 Law, the Regular Salary Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors,
21 and other fiscal control laws of this State, where applicable, and
22 regulations promulgated by the Department of Finance and Administration, as
23 authorized by law, shall be strictly complied with in disbursement of said
24 funds.
25 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024

5
6 SECTION 10. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
7 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
8 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
9 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
10 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
11 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
12 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
13 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
14 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
15 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
16 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
