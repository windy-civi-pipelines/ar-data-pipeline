11 SECTION 2. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
12 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that public schools need ample time
13 to select and announce the school calendar for the upcoming school year,
14 which requires meetings and determinations of certain dates; that for
15 purposes of teacher and administrator contracts, establishing the school
16 calendar is vital; and that this act is immediately necessary because public
17 schools need to know as soon as possible what the statutory requirements are
18 with respect to establishing the school calendars for the upcoming school
19 year. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being
20 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and
21 safety shall become effective on:
22 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
23 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
24 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
25 bill; or
26 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
27 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto."
