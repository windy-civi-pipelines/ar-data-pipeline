23
24 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. FINDINGS AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT. (a) The
25 General Assembly finds that:
26 (1) The first court battle to implement the decision in Brown v.
27 Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), was fought in the town of Hoxie,
28 Arkansas, which sparked the first federal support of integration after the
29 decision in Brown, supra, and the first court order overturning state
30 segregation laws;
31 (2) In the summer of 1955, the Hoxie School Board voluntarily
32 desegregated its schools and fully integrated all school facilities;
33 (3) The newly formed White Citizens’ Council saw the integration
34 as a test for southern resistance to the decision in Brown, supra, and
35 descended on Hoxie with efforts to force the Hoxie School Board to rescind
36 its desegregation;

As Engrossed: H1/27/25 HB1194
1 (4) Despite these efforts, the Hoxie superintendent and the
2 Hoxie School Board stood their ground;
3 (5) With the help of the National Association for the
4 Advancement of Colored People, the Hoxie School Board sought an injunction
5 against segregationist groups, eventually drawing the United States
6 Government’s support in a case that nullified state segregation laws;
7 (6) Segregationist leaders were so furious over their loss in
8 the case that they turned on Governor Orval Faubus in the next primary,
9 forcing him out of his previously moderate stance and setting up the 1957
10 confrontation at Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas;
11 (7) Life Magazine chronicled the Hoxie integration, which was
12 viewed as a success despite students, the families of students, and school
13 administrators experiencing dynamic challenges during this historic and
14 transformative time; and
15 (8) The first court battle for school desegregation in Hoxie
16 changed the face of Arkansas public schools.
17 (b) It is the intent of this act to place a monument on the State
18 Capitol grounds in recognition and appreciation of the historic integration
19 of Hoxie public schools in 1955.
