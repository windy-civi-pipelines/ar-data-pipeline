2
3 SECTION 6. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE
4 ARKANSAS CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
5 TRANSFER AUTHORITY. The Director of the Department of Education – Division of
6 Public School Academic Facilities and Transportation, with the approval of
7 the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and after approval by the Arkansas
8 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, is hereby authorized to
9 request necessary appropriation transfers and any other budget related
10 adjustments necessary only for the appropriations authorized in this Act.
11 Furthermore, it is the intent of the General Assembly that the Department of
12 Education - Division of Public School Academic Facilities and Transportation
13 be able to make use of additional contractual services as necessary and that
14 transfers between line items and among appropriations are anticipated to
15 accomplish those purposes. Provided, however, that the Department of
16 Education - Division of Public School Academic Facilities and Transportation
17 shall be limited to submitting no more than two transfer requests during any
18 fiscal year.
19 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
20 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year
21 is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished by
22 delineating such maximums in the appropriation act(s) for a state agency and
23 the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund account by
24 amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly
25 has determined that the Department of Education – Division of Public School
26 Academic Facilities and Transportation may operate more efficiently if some
27 flexibility is provided to the Director of the Department of Education –
28 Division of Public School Academic Facilities and Transportation authorizing
29 broad powers under the Transfer Authority provision herein. Therefore, it is
30 both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight
31 by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
32 Committee as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the
33 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this
34 section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint
35 Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent
36 jurisdiction, this entire section is void.

1 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
2 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
3
4 SECTION 7. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
5 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
6 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
7 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
8 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
9 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
10 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
11 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
12 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
13
14 SECTION 8. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
15 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
16 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
17 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
18 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
19 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
20 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
21 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
22
23 SECTION 9. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
24 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
25 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
26 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
27 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
28 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
29 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
30 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
31 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
32 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
33 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
