4 SECTION 12. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
5 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
6 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
7 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
8 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
9 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
10 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
11 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
12 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
13 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
14 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
