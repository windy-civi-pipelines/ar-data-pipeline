19 TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR ARKANSAS'S
20 PARTICIPATION IN THE CRISIS RECOVERY
21 SUPPORT NETWORK COORDINATED BY THE
22 SOUTHERN REGIONAL EDUCATION BOARD.
23
24 WHEREAS, after natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods,
25 following school shooting events, and during the course of public
26 emergencies, recovery must be prioritized as a long-term process rather than
27 an immediate, short-term response process; and
28
29 WHEREAS, states, school districts, and postsecondary institutions have
30 focused on crisis prevention and management, but may not have the capacity to
31 provide sustained support for students, teachers, communities, and even their
32 own counselors during the recovery stage following a crisis; and
33
34 WHEREAS, rural schools and postsecondary institutions in particular tend to
35 have fewer counselors and limited access to additional counseling resources;

2 WHEREAS, school counselors are often expected to respond to student needs
3 after a crisis, even as they themselves grapple with the emotional toll
4 following a crisis, which underscores the need for external support for the
5 entire school community; and
6
7 WHEREAS, schools and postsecondary institutions affected by a crisis may
8 require at least one (1) year of dedicated support to fully recover following
9 the crisis; and
10
11 WHEREAS, recovery efforts following a crisis can strain resources that are
12 already stretched thin, given that a National Center for Education Statistics
13 study showed than less than one-half (1/2) of public schools surveyed believe
14 that their school is able to provide mental health services to all students
15 who are in need; and
16
17 WHEREAS, crisis recovery is an extended healing process for students and
18 adults alike, and having additional counselors come to the aid of a school or
19 postsecondary institution in extreme need supports the healing process of all
20 people in an affected community, including teachers and counselors at an
21 affected school or postsecondary institution; and
22
23 WHEREAS, specialized training for counselors is essential to ensure that the
24 counselors have psychological first aid training and can provide counseling
25 that aligns with the unique needs of an educational environment; and
26
27 WHEREAS, research shows that students who receive adequate support after a
28 crisis are more likely to succeed academically, remain in school, and
29 contribute positively to society; and
30
31 WHEREAS, the Southern Regional Education Board, with its seventy-five-year
32 history of partnering with states to improve education, is uniquely equipped
33 to lead this effort because of its ability to mobilize key education and
34 policymaking stakeholders at all levels,

4 THAT the Southern Regional Education Board, in close collaboration with
5 governors' offices, state education agencies, local schools, and

19 Support Network.
20
21 BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT upon adoption, a copy of this resolution shall be
22 provided to the Southern Regional Education Board by the Chief Clerk of the
