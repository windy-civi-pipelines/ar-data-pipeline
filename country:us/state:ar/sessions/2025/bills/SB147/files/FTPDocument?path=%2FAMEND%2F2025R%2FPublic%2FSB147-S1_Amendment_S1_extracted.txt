(4) In the event the secretary or the chief executive officer or
his or her designee of a public institution of higher education exempt from

SECTION 9. Arkansas Code § 19-4-1405(e), concerning bidding
procedures, is amended to read as follows:
(e)(1)(A) When it is obvious from examination of the bid document that
it was the intent of a bidder to submit a responsive bid and because of a
scrivener's error, the bid, if accepted, would create a serious financial
loss to the bidder, the Secretary of the Department of Transformation and
Shared Administrative Services may relieve the bidder from responsibility
under his or her bond and may reject the bid.
(B) However, for projects undertaken by public
institutions of higher education exempt from review and approval of the

under his or her bond and may reject his or her bid in the same manner and
within the same period as allowed by the division.
(2) As used in this section, “scrivener's error” means:
(A) An error in the calculation of a bid which can be
documented by clear and convincing written evidence and which can be clearly
shown by objective evidence drawn from inspection of the original work
papers, documents, or materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to
be withdrawn; and
(B) In the case of a bid sought to be withdrawn, the bid
was submitted in good faith and the mistake was due to a calculation or
clerical error, an inadvertent omission, or a typographical error as opposed
to an error in judgment.
(3)(A) To receive relief under subdivision (e)(1) of this
section, the bidder must serve written notice to the secretary or to the
MAG008 - 02-04-2025 03:53:17 Amendment No. 1 to Senate Bill 147 Page 6 of 67

chief executive officer or his or her designee of a public institution of
higher education exempt from review and approval of the division any time
after the bid opening, but no later than seventy-two (72) hours after
receiving the intent to award, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
(B) Failure to make a withdrawal request within seventy-
two (72) hours shall constitute a waiver by the bidder of the bidder's right
to claim that the mistake in his or her bid was a scrivener's error.
(4) In the event the secretary or the chief executive officer or
his or her designee of a public institution of higher education exempt from
review and approval of the division has relieved the bidder from
responsibility under his or her bond, action on the remaining bids should be
considered as though the withdrawn bid had not been received.
SECTION 10. Arkansas Code § 19-4-1413(a)(2), concerning projects
constructed with private funds, is amended to read as follows:
(2)(A) Before the public institution of higher education shall
enter into a contract with an architect, engineer, construction manager, or
