4 SECTION 9. Arkansas Code § 19-4-1405(e), concerning bidding

6 (e)(1)(A) When it is obvious from examination of the bid document that

22 papers, documents, or materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to
23 be withdrawn; and
24 (B) In the case of a bid sought to be withdrawn, the bid
25 was submitted in good faith and the mistake was due to a calculation or
26 clerical error, an inadvertent omission, or a typographical error as opposed
27 to an error in judgment.
28 (3)(A) To receive relief under subdivision (e)(1) of this
29 section, the bidder must serve written notice to the secretary or to the
30 chief executive officer or his or her designee of a public institution of
31 higher education exempt from review and approval of the division any time
32 after the bid opening, but no later than seventy-two (72) hours after
33 receiving the intent to award, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
34 (B) Failure to make a withdrawal request within seventy-
35 two (72) hours shall constitute a waiver by the bidder of the bidder's right
36 to claim that the mistake in his or her bid was a scrivener's error.

6 (e)(1)(A) When it is obvious from examination of the bid document that

9 loss to the bidder, the Secretary of the Department of Transformation and

11 under his or her bond and may reject the bid.
12 (B) However, for projects undertaken by public

14 division, the chief executive officer of the public institution of higher
15 education or his or her designee may relieve the bidder from responsibility
16 under his or her bond and may reject his or her bid in the same manner and

22 papers, documents, or materials used in the preparation of the bid sought to
23 be withdrawn; and
24 (B) In the case of a bid sought to be withdrawn, the bid
25 was submitted in good faith and the mistake was due to a calculation or
26 clerical error, an inadvertent omission, or a typographical error as opposed
27 to an error in judgment.
28 (3)(A) To receive relief under subdivision (e)(1) of this
29 section, the bidder must serve written notice to the secretary or to the
30 chief executive officer or his or her designee of a public institution of
31 higher education exempt from review and approval of the division any time
32 after the bid opening, but no later than seventy-two (72) hours after
33 receiving the intent to award, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
34 (B) Failure to make a withdrawal request within seventy-
35 two (72) hours shall constitute a waiver by the bidder of the bidder's right
36 to claim that the mistake in his or her bid was a scrivener's error.
