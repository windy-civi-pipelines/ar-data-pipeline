7 and remittance of the tax due, and the tax shall be due from the purchaser at
8 the time of the withdrawal from stock.
9 (c)(1) The secretary may provide sale for resale certificates to
10 assist retailers in properly accounting for nontaxable sales of tangible

19 certificates, obtain a new copy of a farmer sales tax identification card, or

21 recurring business relationship between the purchaser and seller.
22 (3) A recurring business relationship exists when a period of no
23 more than twelve (12) months elapses between sales transactions.

25 the secretary is relieved from any tax otherwise applicable if it is
26 determined that the purchaser improperly claimed an exemption.
