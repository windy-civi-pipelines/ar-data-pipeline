31 This statute shall be known and cited as the Dentist and Dental
32 Hygienist Compact. The purposes of this Compact are to facilitate the
33 interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access

As Engrossed: H3/12/25 SB111
1 establishing a pathway for Dentists and Dental Hygienists licensed in a
2 Participating State to obtain a Compact Privilege that authorizes them to
3 practice in another Participating State in which they are not licensed. The
4 Compact enables Participating States to protect the public health and safety
5 with respect to the practice of such Dentists and Dental Hygienists, through
6 the State’s authority to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental
7 hygiene in the State. The Compact:

9 Privilege to practice in other Participating States without satisfying
10 burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with securing a License to
11 practice in those States;
12 B. Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each
13 Participating State’s acceptance of a Compact Privilege to practice in that
14 State;
15 C. Increases public access to qualified, licensed Dentists and Dental
16 Hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for Licensees to
17 practice in Participating States;
18 D. Enhances the ability of Participating States to protect the
19 public’s health and safety;
20 E. Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a
21 Participating State;
22 F. Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information
23 among Participating States;
24 G. Requires Dentists and Dental Hygienists who practice in a
25 Participating State pursuant to a Compact Privilege to practice within the
26 Scope of Practice authorized in that State;
27 H. Extends the authority of a Participating State to regulate the
28 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to Dentists and
29 Dental Hygienists who practice in the State through a Compact Privilege;
30 I. Promotes the cooperation of Participating States in regulating the
31 practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those States;
32 J. Facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses
33 who are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

3 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
4 B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each

29 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may
30 consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 hours’ notice, with opportunity
31 to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the
32 Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as
33 soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after

10 period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only
11 on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a Rule. A
12 challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to

22 each Participating State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions
23 necessary and appropriate to implement the Compact.
24 2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the

26 jurisdiction where the principal office of the Commission is located. The

29 proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety
30 of venue in any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice,
31 misconduct or any such similar matter.
32 3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of
33 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the
34 Compact or Commission Rule and shall have standing to intervene in such a

As Engrossed: H3/12/25 SB111
1 Compact, or promulgated Rules.

11 to the other Participating States.
12 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
13 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
14 majority of the Commissioners, and all rights, privileges and benefits
15 conferred on that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective
16 date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending
17 State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.
18 D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be imposed only
19 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of
20 intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the

23 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is
24 necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
25 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall
26 not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue
27 any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting Participating
28 State’s law.
29 3. A Participating State may initiate legal action against the
30 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
31 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce
32 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The
33 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event
34 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all
35 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

16 remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number
17 of Participating States should be less than seven (7).
18 2. Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent to the
19 Charter Participating States shall be subject to the process set forth in
20 Section 7.C.23 to determine if their enactments are materially different from

22 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in
23 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the

25 be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated
26 by the Commission.
27 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the
28 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the
29 Commission’s Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact
30 becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the
31 Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact

13 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a
14 Participating State and a non-Participating State that does not conflict with
15 the provisions of this Compact.
16 D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating States. No
17 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any
18 Participating State until it is enacted into the laws of all Participating
19 States.
20
21 SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
22 A. This Compact and the Commission’s rulemaking authority shall be
23 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation
24 and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly
25 authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to
26 limit the Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.
27 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
28 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a court of
29 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any
30 Participating State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the
31 United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person
32 or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
33 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the
34 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance
35 shall not be affected thereby.

2 requirements of Section 10.B, terminate a Participating State’s participation
3 in the Compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a
4 Participating State is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if
5 this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any
