1 SECTION 5. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
2 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
3 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
4 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
5 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
6 Procedures and Restrictions Act, the Higher Education Expenditure Restriction
7 Act, or their successors, and other fiscal control laws of this State, where
8 applicable, and regulations promulgated by the Department of Finance and
9 Administration, as authorized by law, shall be strictly complied with in
10 disbursement of said funds.
11
12 SECTION 6. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
13 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
14 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
15 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
16 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
17 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
18 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
19 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
20
21 SECTION 7. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
22 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
23 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
24 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
25 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
26 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
27 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
28 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
29 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
30 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
31 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.

1 SECTION 5. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds

4 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
5 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
6 Procedures and Restrictions Act, the Higher Education Expenditure Restriction
7 Act, or their successors, and other fiscal control laws of this State, where

21 SECTION 7. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
22 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
23 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
24 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
25 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
26 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
27 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
28 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
29 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
30 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
31 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
