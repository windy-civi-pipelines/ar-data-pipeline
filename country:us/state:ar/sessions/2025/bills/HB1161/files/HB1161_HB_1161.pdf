HB1161
1 the amount of the annuity received when he or she retired and the new annuity
2 due as a result of the election change, plus interest from July 1, 1994, or
3 his or her retirement date, whichever is later, to the date of payment in
4 full.
5 (ii) The difference shall be calculated retroactively
6 to July 1, 1994, or his or her the retiree's retirement date, whichever is
7 later.
8 (2) The election to change shall be made only one (1) time.
9 (3) The election change shall be effective retroactively to the
10 effective date of his or her annuity the month following the retiree's

12 section.
13
14 SECTION 2. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
15 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the operations of a state
16 public retirement system are complex; that the Arkansas Teacher Retirement
17 System must be able to meet the needs of its members as anticipated by the
18 General Assembly; that certain provisions of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement
19 System Act, ยง 24-7-201 et seq., need immediate revision and updating to
20 address administrative complexities caused by these provisions and to bring
21 these provisions into conformance with sound public pension policy and
22 actuarial requirements; that the revisions and updates are of great
23 importance to members of the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and to other
24 citizens of the State of Arkansas; that as the Arkansas Teacher Retirement
25 System operates on a fiscal year of July 1 to June 30, an effective date of
26 July 1, 2025, is necessary in order to allow the provisions within this act
27 to begin on the first day of the fiscal year and to allow for a structured
28 and proper administration of the procedures referenced in this act; that the
29 updates and revisions to the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System Act are of
30 great importance and necessary for protecting member benefits and clarifying
31 the reporting and contribution requirements of employers participating in the
32 Arkansas Teacher Retirement System; and that this act is necessary in order
33 to maintain an orderly system of benefits for the members of the Arkansas
34 Teacher Retirement System. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and
35 this act being necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health,
36 and safety, shall become effective on July 1, 2025.
