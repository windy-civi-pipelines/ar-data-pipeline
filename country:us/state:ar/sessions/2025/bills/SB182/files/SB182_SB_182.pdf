2 02/03/2025 4:31:11 PM SSS134

SB182
1 (a) Under this subchapter, the governing body of the municipality
2 shall, on or before February 1 of each year, adopt a budget by ordinance or
3 resolution for operation of the city or town municipality.
4 (b)(1) If the governing body of the municipality has not adopted a

27
28 SECTION 5. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
29 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that when the governing body of a
30 county or municipality does not pass an annual appropriation ordinance, the
31 county or municipality cannot provide basic services and the employees of the
32 county or municipality cannot be paid; that this act will allow expenditures
33 to be paid until an annual appropriation ordinance is in place; that the lack
34 of an appropriation ordinance makes it impossible for the county or
35 municipality to provide necessary services to the residents of the county or
36 municipality, which threatens the public peace, health, and safety of the
3 02/03/2025 4:31:11 PM SSS134

SB182
1 residents of the county or municipality; and that this act is immediately
2 necessary because failure to pass an annual appropriation ordinance puts
3 employees of the county or municipality in financial distress and at risk of
4 being unable to pay for financial responsibilities. Therefore, an emergency
5 is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the
6 preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective
7 on:
8 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
9 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
10 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
11 bill; or
12 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
13 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
