24
25 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
26 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
27 (1) Emergency medical situations can present a danger to the
28 life of pregnant women and unborn children if proper care and treatment is
29 not rendered;
30 (2)(A) In a tragic case where pregnancy poses a serious danger
31 to a pregnant woman’s life, the General Assembly has prescribed an objective
32 standard, requiring a doctor to exercise “reasonable medical judgment” before
33 ending the pregnancy.
34 (B) The reasonable medical judgment standard is the
35 longstanding norm and applies in all medical contexts;
36 (3)(A) The reasonable medical judgment standard has never been

1 found unworkable or vague in any medical context, including abortion.
2 (B) Under Karlin v. Foust, 188 F.3d 446, 464 (7th Cir.
3 1999), the reasonable medical judgement standard “is the same standard by
4 which all ... medical decisions are judged under traditional theories of tort
5 law”; and
6 (4) The addition of guidance and clarifications in state law
7 ensures that physicians and medical facilities will continue to administer
8 appropriate emergency medical treatment to save the lives of pregnant women
9 in medical emergencies.
10 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide guidance and
11 clarification regarding abortion laws and appropriate emergency medical
12 procedures to save the lives of pregnant women.
