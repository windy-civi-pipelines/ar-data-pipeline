14 general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year is the
15 prerogative of the General Assembly.
16 (2) The purposes of subsection (a) of this section are typically
17 accomplished by:
18 (A) Identifying the purpose in the appropriation act;
19 (B) Delineating such maximums in the appropriation act for a
20 state agency; and
21 (C) Delineating the general revenue allocations authorized for
22 each fund and fund account by amendment to the revenue stabilization law.
23 (3) It is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly
24 restrict the use of appropriations authorized in this act.
25 (b)(1) Upon the request of the Governor or the General Assembly, the
26 Department of Human Services shall request a waiver from the federal
27 government to:

9 (2) If the federal government denies the waiver application, this
10 section shall not be implemented.
11 (3) If the division does not request a wavier under subdivision
12 (b)(1) of this section, the department shall not allocate, budget, expend, or
13 utilize appropriations under this act for the participation of persons in the
14 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program.
15 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
16 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
17
18 SECTION 12. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
19 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
20 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
21 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
22 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
23 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
24 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
25 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
26 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
27
28 SECTION 13. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
29 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
30 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
31 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive

As Engrossed: H2/27/25 HB1107
1 SECTION 14. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
2 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
3 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
4 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
5 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
6 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
7 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
8 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
9 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
10 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
11 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
