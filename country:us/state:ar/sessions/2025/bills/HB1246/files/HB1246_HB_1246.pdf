34 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
35 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
36 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
7 01/27/2025 1:19:47 PM HAR011

HB1246
1 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
2 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
3 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
4 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
5 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
