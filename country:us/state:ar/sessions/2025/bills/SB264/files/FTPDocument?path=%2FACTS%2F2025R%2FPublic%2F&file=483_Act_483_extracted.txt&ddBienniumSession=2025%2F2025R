19 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
20 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
21 (1) There is extensive data demonstrating that a population’s
22 increased access to quality primary care reduces overall healthcare costs and
23 improves health outcomes;
24 (2) Without access to high-quality primary care, healthcare
25 costs rise, preventable health issues escalate, and chronic disease burden
26 worsens;
27 (3) Studies demonstrate that investing more in primary care
28 reduces health system costs and improves a population’s health; and
29 (4) A population’s increased access to primary care results in
30 fewer emergency department visits, hospital stays, and surgeries.
31 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to form a working group
32 to better understand the primary care system in this state and its effect on
33 health outcomes for Arkansans.
