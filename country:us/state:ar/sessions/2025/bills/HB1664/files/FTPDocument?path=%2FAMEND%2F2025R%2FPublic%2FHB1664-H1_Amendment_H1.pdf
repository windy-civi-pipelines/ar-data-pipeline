"SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
(a) The General Assembly finds that:
(1) Child maltreatment investigations have at times led to
the wrongful or mistaken allegation of child maltreatment against a parent or
other caretaker when the child's symptoms that may, at first or superficial
glance, appear to be manifestations of abuse or neglect, are actually the
result of a medical condition that may or may not be known to the child's
family, including genetic conditions that the parent himself or herself may
unknowingly have;
(2) When such a child maltreatment investigation results
in a child being removed from his or her home and placed in foster care, it
may result in varying levels of trauma to the child, his or her siblings, his
or her parent or parents, and other members of the child's family;
(3) A parent or other caretaker of a child who is
wrongfully or mistakenly alleged to have caused or contributed to the abuse
or neglect of a child who is actually presenting symptoms of a medical
condition that are not caused by abuse or neglect to the child may be
subjected to not only separation from his or her child, but also threats to
his or her liberty in the form of having a petition for dependency-neglect or
a petition for termination of parental rights filed against him or her, or
even having his or her name placed on the Child Maltreatment Central Registry
or a criminal prosecution against him or her when there was not in fact child
maltreatment or a criminal offense committed;
(4) These detrimental effects can cause loss of time,
money, and mental and emotional wellbeing to many persons affected by the
wrongful or mistaken allegation of child maltreatment; and
(5) Although the intent of the Child Maltreatment Act, §
12-18-101 et seq., is to protect children from maltreatment, wrongful or
mistaken allegations of child maltreatment for symptoms of a medical
condition may actually contribute to the child's suffering not only in the
form of trauma, but also in that, if a child's underlying medical condition
is overlooked or ignored, the child remains untreated for that medical
condition and the parent or caretaker deprived of otherwise discovering and
being able to provide for the proper medical care of his or her child.
(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly for this act to
contribute not only to the protection of a wrongfully or mistakenly accused
LJH289 - 04-01-2025 05:16:02 Amendment No. 1 to House Bill 1664 Page 2 of 6

parent, but also the protection of the child, the family unit, and the
overall integrity of the state's child welfare, hospital, and legal systems.
SECTION 2. Arkansas Code § 12-18-614 is amended to read as follows:

(b)(1)(B)(i) of this section shall be paid for by the alleged offender or as

(iii) If the alleged victim undergoes genetic
testing under subdivision (b)(1)(B)(i) of this section, the genetic testing
shall include a complete family medical history even if the alleged victim's
family members have not been diagnosed with a genetic condition, which shall
include the licensed healthcare provider who routinely provides medical care
to pediatric patients ascertaining if there is a family medical history of:
(a) Joint hypermobility;
(b) Sprains;
(c) Bruising;
(d) Connective tissue disorder or the physical

12-18-624. Right of parent, guardian, or custodian to medical records

providing medical records under this section.
(5) A healthcare institution or provider that fails to provide
medical records under this section pursuant to a valid court order may be

SECTION 4. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that "Quincy's Law", Acts 2021, No.
976, is a crucial protection for persons who are the subject of an
investigation under the Child Maltreatment Act, § 12-18-101 et seq.; that
since the enactment of Quincy's Law in 2021, an additional need for further
protections under Quincy's Law has been demonstrated, most notably to provide
further clarity in child maltreatment investigations involving differential
diagnoses that may present as possible child abuse without additional testing
that the provisions in this act make available; that this act is needed not
only to protect wrongfully accused parents, but also to assist a parent who
may not be aware of his or her child's condition and be given the opportunity
to provide his or her child necessary medical treatment; that this act is
also urgent to protect families from undergoing unnecessary trauma related to
family separation and wrongful or mistaken allegations of child maltreatment
that are actually manifestations of medical conditions; and that numerous
child maltreatment investigations are taking place at any given time, and
thus there is an urgent need for the provisions in this act to become
effective. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and
safety shall become effective on:
(1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
(2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
bill; or
(3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto."
