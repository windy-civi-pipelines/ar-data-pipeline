28
29 SECTION 1. DO NOT CODIFY. Legislative findings and intent.
30 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
31 (1) Child maltreatment investigations have at times led to
32 the wrongful or mistaken allegation of child maltreatment against a parent or
33 other caretaker when the child's symptoms that may, at first or superficial
34 glance, appear to be manifestations of abuse or neglect, are actually the
35 result of a medical condition that may or may not be known to the child's
36 family, including genetic conditions that the parent himself or herself may

1 unknowingly have;
2 (2) When such a child maltreatment investigation results
3 in a child being removed from his or her home and placed in foster care, it
4 may result in varying levels of trauma to the child, his or her siblings, his
5 or her parent or parents, and other members of the child's family;
6 (3) A parent or other caretaker of a child who is
7 wrongfully or mistakenly alleged to have caused or contributed to the abuse
8 or neglect of a child who is actually presenting symptoms of a medical
9 condition that are not caused by abuse or neglect to the child may be
10 subjected to not only separation from his or her child, but also threats to
11 his or her liberty in the form of having a petition for dependency-neglect or
12 a petition for termination of parental rights filed against him or her, or
13 even having his or her name placed on the Child Maltreatment Central Registry
14 or a criminal prosecution against him or her when there was not in fact child
15 maltreatment or a criminal offense committed;
16 (4) These detrimental effects can cause loss of time,
17 money, and mental and emotional wellbeing to many persons affected by the
18 wrongful or mistaken allegation of child maltreatment; and
19 (5) Although the intent of the Child Maltreatment Act, §
20 12-18-101 et seq., is to protect children from maltreatment, wrongful or
21 mistaken allegations of child maltreatment for symptoms of a medical
22 condition may actually contribute to the child's suffering not only in the
23 form of trauma, but also in that, if a child's underlying medical condition
24 is overlooked or ignored, the child remains untreated for that medical
25 condition and the parent or caretaker deprived of otherwise discovering and
26 being able to provide for the proper medical care of his or her child.
27 (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly for this act to
28 contribute not only to the protection of a wrongfully or mistakenly accused
29 parent, but also the protection of the child, the family unit, and the
30 overall integrity of the state's child welfare, hospital, and legal systems.

34 SECTION 4. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
35 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that "Quincy's Law", Acts 2021, No.
36 976, is a crucial protection for persons who are the subject of an
5 04-02-2025 10:58:22 LJH157

As Engrossed: H4/2/25 HB1664
1 investigation under the Child Maltreatment Act, § 12-18-101 et seq.; that
2 since the enactment of Quincy's Law in 2021, an additional need for further
3 protections under Quincy's Law has been demonstrated, most notably to provide
4 further clarity in child maltreatment investigations involving differential
5 diagnoses that may present as possible child abuse without additional testing
6 that the provisions in this act make available; that this act is needed not
7 only to protect wrongfully accused parents, but also to assist a parent who
8 may not be aware of his or her child's condition and be given the opportunity
9 to provide his or her child necessary medical treatment; that this act is
10 also urgent to protect families from undergoing unnecessary trauma related to
11 family separation and wrongful or mistaken allegations of child maltreatment
12 that are actually manifestations of medical conditions; and that numerous
13 child maltreatment investigations are taking place at any given time, and
14 thus there is an urgent need for the provisions in this act to become
15 effective. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being
16 immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and
17 safety shall become effective on:
18 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
19 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
20 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
21 bill; or
22 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
23 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
