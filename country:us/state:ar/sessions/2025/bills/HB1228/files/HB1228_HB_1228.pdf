7 SECTION 8. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
8 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
9 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
10 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
11 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
12 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
13 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
14 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
15 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
16 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
17 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
