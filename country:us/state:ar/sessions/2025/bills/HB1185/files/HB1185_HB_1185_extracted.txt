15 A. The Compact Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order
16 to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and
17 provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and have no force or
18 effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is

21 granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review.
22 B. The Rules of the Compact Commission shall have the force of law in
23 each Member State, provided however that where the Rules conflict with the
24 laws or regulations of a Member State that relate to the procedures, actions,
25 and processes a Licensed Dietitian is permitted to undertake in that State
26 and the circumstances under which they may do so, as held by a court of
27 competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Compact Commission shall be
28 ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.
29 C. The Compact Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers
30 pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted
31 thereunder. Rules shall become binding on the day following adoption or as of

34 Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the
35 same manner used to adopt the Compact within four (4) years of the date of
36 adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further force and effect
19 02-27-2025 10:52:30 JMB029
As Engrossed: H2/13/25 H2/26/25 H2/27/25 HB1185

7 G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Compact Commission, and
8 at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the Compact
9 Commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Compact
10 Commission shall provide a Notice of Proposed rulemaking:
11 1. On the website of the Compact Commission or other publicly
12 accessible platform;
13 2. To persons who have requested notice of the Compact
14 Commission’s notices of proposed rulemaking; and
15 3. In such other way(s) as the Compact Commission may by Rule
16 specify.
17 H. The Notice of Proposed rulemaking shall include:
18 1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which
19 the Compact Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if
20 different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the Compact
21 Commission will consider and vote on the proposed Rule;
22 2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video
23 conference, or other means of communication, the Compact Commission shall
24 include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice of Proposed
25 rulemaking;
26 3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefore;
27 4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any
28 interested person; and
29 5. The manner in which interested persons may submit written
30 comments.
31 I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all
32 written comments and documents received by the Compact Commission in response
33 to the proposed Rule shall be available to the public.
34 J. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring a separate
35 hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Compact
36 Commission at hearings required by this Section.

5 provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed
6 Rule.
7 2. The Compact Commission shall provide an explanation of the
8 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons
9 for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.

11 date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Section 10(L), the
12 effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the
13 notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
14 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Compact Commission
15 may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 hours’ notice, with
16 opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures
17 provided in the Compact and in this Section shall be retroactively applied to
18 the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety
19 (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this
20 provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order
21 to:
22 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;
23 2. Prevent a loss of Compact Commission or Member State funds;
24 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is
25 established by federal law or rule; or
26 4. Protect public health and safety.
27 M. The Compact Commission or an authorized committee of the Compact
28 Commission may direct revision to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of
29 correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or
30 grammatical errors. Public notice of any revision shall be posted on the
31 website of the Compact Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge
32 by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision
33 may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material
34 change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
35 Compact Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
36 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision

4 Compact.

7 A. Oversight
8 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
9 each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary
10 and appropriate to implement this Compact.
11 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is proper
12 and judicial proceedings by or against the Compact Commission shall be
13 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the
14 principal office of the Compact Commission is located. The Compact Commission
15 may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or
16 consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.
17 Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
18 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or
19 any such similar matter.
20 3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service
21 of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of

24 render a judgment or order void as to the Compact Commission, this Compact,
25 or promulgated Rules.
26 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
27 1. If the Compact Commission determines that a Member State has
28 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under

32 that the Compact Commission may take and shall offer training and specific
33 technical assistance regarding the default.
34 2. The Compact Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
35 default to the other Member States.
36 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting

As Engrossed: H2/13/25 H2/26/25 H2/27/25 HB1185
1 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
2 majority of the delegates of the Member States, and all rights, privileges,
3 and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be terminated
4 on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
5 the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period
6 of default.
7 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only
8 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of
9 intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Compact Commission to
10 the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State’s
11 legislature, the defaulting State’s Licensing Authority, and each of the
12 Member States’ Licensing Authority.

21 months after the date of said notice of termination.

27 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of
28 Columbia or the federal district where the Compact Commission has its
29 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
30 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
31 I. Dispute Resolution
32 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Compact Commission shall
33 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member
34 States and between Member and non-Member States.

36 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.

2 1. By supermajority vote, the Compact Commission may initiate
3 legal action against a Member State in default in the United States District
4 Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Compact
5 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the

7 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
8 is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such

12 defaulting Member State’s law.
13 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Compact
14 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
15 federal district where the Compact Commission has its principal offices to
16 enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
17 Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In
18 the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
19 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

21 against the Compact Commission.

32 materially different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the

7 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Compact Commission
8 or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior
9 to the effective date of the Compact or the Compact Commission coming into
10 existence shall be considered to be actions of the Compact Commission unless

13 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the

30 all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 180
31 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.

4 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
5 A. This Compact and the Compact Commission’s rulemaking authority
6 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
7 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact
8 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be
9 construed to limit the Compact Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for

21 within that Member State; and
22 2. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that
23 require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production
24 of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a Licensing Authority in a Member State for

8 the new Home State of any Adverse Actions.

13 findings of another Remote State, provided that the Member State follows its
14 own procedures for taking the Adverse Action.
15 G. Joint Investigations:

17 respective State law, any Member State may participate with other Member
18 States in joint investigations of Licensees.

28 in all Member States during the pendency of the order.
29 I. Once an Encumbered License in the Home State is restored to an
30 Unencumbered License (as certified by the Home State’s Licensing Authority),
31 the Licensee must meet the requirements of Section 4(A) and follow the
32 administrative requirements to reapply to obtain a Compact Privilege in any
33 Remote State.
34 J. If a Member State takes Adverse Action, it shall promptly notify

2 final action on the proposed Rule based on the rulemaking record and the full

5 provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed
6 Rule.
7 2. The Compact Commission shall provide an explanation of the
8 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons
9 for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters.
10 3. The Compact Commission shall determine a reasonable effective
11 date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Section 10(L), the
12 effective date of the Rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the
13 notice that it adopted or amended the Rule.
14 L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Compact Commission
15 may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 hours’ notice, with
16 opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures
17 provided in the Compact and in this Section shall be retroactively applied to
18 the Rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety
19 (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this

31 website of the Compact Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge

34 change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the
35 Compact Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is
36 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision

6 SECTION 11. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT
7 A. Oversight
8 1. The executive and judicial branches of State government in
9 each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary
10 and appropriate to implement this Compact.
11 2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is proper
12 and judicial proceedings by or against the Compact Commission shall be
13 brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the
14 principal office of the Compact Commission is located. The Compact Commission
15 may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or
16 consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.
17 Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in
18 any action against a Licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or
19 any such similar matter.
20 3. The Compact Commission shall be entitled to receive service
21 of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of
22 the Compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all
23 purposes. Failure to provide the Compact Commission service of process shall
24 render a judgment or order void as to the Compact Commission, this Compact,
25 or promulgated Rules.
26 B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination
27 1. If the Compact Commission determines that a Member State has
28 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under
29 this Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Compact Commission shall provide
30 written notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe
31 the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action
32 that the Compact Commission may take and shall offer training and specific
33 technical assistance regarding the default.
34 2. The Compact Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of
35 default to the other Member States.
36 C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting
22 02-27-2025 10:52:30 JMB029

As Engrossed: H2/13/25 H2/26/25 H2/27/25 HB1185
1 State may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a
2 majority of the delegates of the Member States, and all rights, privileges,
3 and benefits conferred on that State by this Compact may be terminated
4 on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve
5 the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period
6 of default.
7 D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only
8 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of
9 intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Compact Commission to
10 the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting State’s
11 legislature, the defaulting State’s Licensing Authority, and each of the
12 Member States’ Licensing Authority.
13 E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all
14 assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date
15 of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date
16 of termination.
17 F. Upon the termination of a State’s membership from this Compact,
18 that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that
19 State of such termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize
20 all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six
21 months after the date of said notice of termination.
22 G. The Compact Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State
23 that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact,
24 unless agreed upon in writing between the Compact Commission and the
25 defaulting State.
26 H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Compact
27 Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of
28 Columbia or the federal district where the Compact Commission has its
29 principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
30 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
31 I. Dispute Resolution
32 1. Upon request by a Member State, the Compact Commission shall
33 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member
34 States and between Member and non-Member States.
35 2. The Compact Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for
36 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.

1 J. Enforcement
2 1. By supermajority vote, the Compact Commission may initiate
3 legal action against a Member State in default in the United States District
4 Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Compact
5 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the
6 provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may
7 include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement
8 is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such
9 litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The remedies herein shall
10 not be the exclusive remedies of the Compact Commission. The Compact
11 Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
12 defaulting Member State’s law.
13 2. A Member State may initiate legal action against the Compact
14 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the
15 federal district where the Compact Commission has its principal offices to
16 enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated
17 Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In
18 the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
19 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
20 3. No party other than a Member State shall enforce this Compact
21 against the Compact Commission.
22
23 SECTION 12. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT
24 A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact
25 statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State.
26 1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the Compact
27 Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven
28 Member States (“Charter Member States”) to determine if the statute enacted
29 by each such Charter Member State is materially different than the model
30 Compact statute.
31 a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found to be
32 materially different from the model Compact statute shall be entitled to the
33 default process set forth in Section 11.
34 b. If any Member State is later found to be in default, or
35 is terminated, or withdraws from the Compact, the Compact Commission shall
36 remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number
24 02-27-2025 10:52:30 JMB029

As Engrossed: H2/13/25 H2/26/25 H2/27/25 HB1185
1 of Member States should be less than seven.
2 2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the seven
3 initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in
4 Section 8(C)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different
5 from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in
6 the Compact.
7 3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Compact Commission
8 or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior
9 to the effective date of the Compact or the Compact Commission coming into
10 existence shall be considered to be actions of the Compact Commission unless
11 specifically repudiated by the Compact Commission.
12 4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Compact
13 Commission’s initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the
14 Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law
15 in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Compact
16 Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact
17 becomes law in that State.
18 B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a
19 statute repealing the same.
20 1. A Member State’s withdrawal shall not take effect until 180
21 days after enactment of the repealing statute.
22 2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the
23 withdrawing State’s Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative and
24 Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the effective
25 date of withdrawal.
26 3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this
27 Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all
28 Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory
29 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize
30 all Compact Privileges granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 180
31 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal.
32 C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate
33 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a
34 Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the
35 provisions of this Compact.
36 D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to
25 02-27-2025 10:52:30 JMB029

As Engrossed: H2/13/25 H2/26/25 H2/27/25 HB1185
1 this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until
2 it is enacted into the laws of all Member States.
3
4 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
5 A. This Compact and the Compact Commission’s rulemaking authority
6 shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the
7 implementation and administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact
8 expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be
9 construed to limit the Compact Commission’s rulemaking authority solely for
10 those purposes.
11 B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any
12 phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this Compact is held by a court of
13 competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Member
14 State, a State seeking participation in the Compact, or of the United States,
15 or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or
16 circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent
17 jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the
18 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or
19 circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
20 C. Notwithstanding Section 13(B), the Compact Commission may deny a
21 State’s participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements
22 of Section 11(B), terminate a Member State’s participation in the Compact, if
23 it determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a
24 material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held
25 to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall
26 remain in full force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full
27 force and effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable matters.
28
29 SECTION 14. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS
30 A. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any
31 other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact.
32 B. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a
33 Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the
34 conflict.
35 C. All permissible agreements between the Compact Commission and the
36 Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.
