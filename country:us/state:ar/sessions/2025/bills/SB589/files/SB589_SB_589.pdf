9 and comparable data:
10 (A)(i) The actual acquisition cost the covered entity or

29 the same month or, if not available, from the same calendar quarter.
30 (ii) A covered entity or contract pharmacy shall
31 rely on subdivision (2)(C) of this section only if neither subdivision (2)(A)
32 or subdivision (2)(B) of this section is feasible for that specific drug or
