SB348
1 (b) When adopting the initial rules to implement this act, the final
2 rules shall be filed with the Secretary of State for adoption under § 25-15-
3 204(f):
4 (1) On or before January 1, 2026; or
5 (2) If approval under § 10-3-309 has not occurred by January 1,
6 2026, as soon as practicable after approval under § 10-3-309.
7 (c) The department shall file the proposed rules with the Legislative
8 Council under § 10-3-309(c) sufficiently in advance of January 1, 2026, so
9 that the Legislative Council may consider the rules for approval before

11
12 SECTION 3. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
13 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that there is an urgent need to
14 improve efficiency in diagnostic laboratory services within the Arkansas
15 Medicaid Program; that beneficiaries of the Arkansas Medicaid Program are
16 currently not being monitored adequately due to the low annual reimbursement
17 cap on diagnostic laboratory services; that inadequate monitoring due to the
18 low annual reimbursement cap on diagnostic laboratory services contributes to
19 the opioid epidemic through misuse and diversion of medications; that
20 inadequate monitoring due to the low annual reimbursement cap on diagnostic
21 laboratory services also contributes to increased emergency room visits; that
22 the Department of Human Services needs adequate time to draft rules, federal
23 waivers, Medicaid state plan amendments, or other authorization to ensure
24 that this act can be effective; and that this act is necessary to ensure the
25 health and safety of beneficiaries of the Arkansas Medicaid Program and to
26 enhance the patient care for beneficiaries of the Arkansas Medicaid Program.
27 Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being necessary
28 for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become
29 effective on July 1, 2025.
