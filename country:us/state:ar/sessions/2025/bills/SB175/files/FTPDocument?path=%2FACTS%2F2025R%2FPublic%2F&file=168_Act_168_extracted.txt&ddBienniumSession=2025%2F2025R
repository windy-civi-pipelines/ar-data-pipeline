21 SECTION 1. Arkansas Code § 11-10-310(f), concerning the Director of
22 the Division of Workforce Services and personnel of the Division of Workforce
23 Services, is reenacted to ratify the decision by the Arkansas Code Revision
24 Commission to change references to “this section” to “this subsection and
25 subsection (e) of this section” in order to correct reference errors to read
26 as follows:
27 (f) If the division requests continuation of a growth pool position as
28 established under this subsection and subsection (e) of this section, the
29 position shall be requested as a new position in the division's next budget
30 request. Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount
31 of appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal
32 year is the prerogative of the General Assembly. This is usually accomplished
33 by delineating such maximums in the appropriation act or acts for a state
34 agency and the general revenue allocations authorized for each fund and fund
35 account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization Law, § 19-5-101 et seq.
36 Further, the General Assembly has determined that the division may operate

1 more efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the division authorizing
2 broad powers under this subsection and subsection (e) of this section.
3 Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly
4 maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or
5 Joint Budget Committee as provided by this subsection and subsection (e) of
6 this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint
7 Budget Committee is not a severable part of this subsection and subsection
8 (e) of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative
9 Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of
10 competent jurisdiction, this entire subsection and subsection (e) of this
11 section are void.
12
13 SECTION 2. DO NOT CODIFY. CONSTRUCTION AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
14 It is the intent of the General Assembly that:
15 (1) The enactment and adoption of this act shall not expressly
16 or impliedly repeal an act passed during the regular session of the Ninety-
17 Fifth General Assembly;
18 (2) To the extent that a conflict exists between an act of the
19 regular session of the Ninety-Fifth General Assembly and this act:
20 (A) The act of the regular session of the Ninety-Fifth
21 General Assembly shall be treated as a subsequent act passed by the General
22 Assembly for the purposes of:
23 (i) Giving the act of the regular session of the
24 Ninety-Fifth General Assembly its full force and effect; and
25 (ii) Amending or repealing the appropriate parts of
26 the Arkansas Code of 1987; and
27 (B) Section 1-2-107 shall not apply; and
28 (3) This act shall make only technical, not substantive, changes
