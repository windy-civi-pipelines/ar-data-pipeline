22 2-1-401. Title.

26 2-1-402. Findings.
27 The General Assembly finds that:
28 (1) Environmental, social, and governance activists demand “zero
29 emissions on farm machinery” but ignore that electric heavy farm machinery
30 would be far larger than diesel counterparts, would require extensive
31 charging infrastructure on farms to meet harvesting demands, may struggle in
32 cold weather, and simply is not feasible for farmers in Arkansas;
33 (2) Farmers in Arkansas depend on the availability of financing,
34 and consumers depend on farmers for food;
35 (3) Reducing financing, restricting fertilizer usage, or forcing
36 farmers to purchase electric farm machinery may put farmers out of business
