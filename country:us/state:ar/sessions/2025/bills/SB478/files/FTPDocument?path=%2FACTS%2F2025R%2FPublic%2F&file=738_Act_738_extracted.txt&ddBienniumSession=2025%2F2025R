29 Engine Freedom Act of 2025".
30
31 27-38-302. Legislative findings and intent.
32 (a) The General Assembly finds that:
33 (1) United States Constitution, Article I, § 8, Clause 3, grants
34 the United States Congress the power to regulate commerce "among the several
35 states" but does not grant the United States Congress the power to regulate
36 intrastate commerce or activities that occur solely within one (1) state;
*ZRC077*
03/17/2025 2:27:34 PM ZRC077
SB478
1 (2) The mandate of the United States Government requiring the
2 use of diesel exhaust fluid in diesel engines operating solely within this
3 state exceeds the powers delegated to the United States Congress under United
4 States Constitution, Article I, § 8, Clause 3, and is therefore
5 unconstitutional;
6 (3) Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,
7 powers that are not delegated to the United States Government nor prohibited
8 to the states are reserved to the states or to the people, granting this
9 state the authority to regulate emissions standards for vehicles used solely
10 within this state; and
11 (4) It is the duty of this state to protect its citizens from
12 unconstitutional overreach and burdensome regulations that are outside of the
13 bounds of the authority of the United States Government.
14 (b) The General Assembly intends for this subchapter to:
15 (1) Assert the sovereign right of this state under the Tenth
16 Amendment to the United States Constitution to regulate emissions standards
17 for vehicles operating solely within this state when the vehicles are not
18 engaged in interstate commerce;
19 (2) Declare that a federal regulation, executive order, or
20 mandate requiring the use of diesel exhaust fluid in diesel engines operating
21 solely within this state is null and void as it exceeds the constitutional
22 authority granted to the United States Congress under United States
23 Constitution, Article I, § 8, Clause 3; and
24 (3) Ensure that a state entity shall not enforce or attempt to
25 enforce a regulation requiring the use of diesel exhaust fluid for vehicles
26 operating solely within this state.

28 27-38-303. Definitions.

34 produce, sell, install, use, or operate an exempt engine solely within this
35 state;

14 diesel regulation that infringes on an exempt engine right or that requires
