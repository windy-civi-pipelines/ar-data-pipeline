14 facts in appropriate detail the court finds that there is imminent danger to
15 the life or health of an incapacitated person or of loss, damage, or waste to
16 the property of an incapacitated person and that this requires the immediate

20 include a date and time certain, not to exceed fourteen (14) days from the
