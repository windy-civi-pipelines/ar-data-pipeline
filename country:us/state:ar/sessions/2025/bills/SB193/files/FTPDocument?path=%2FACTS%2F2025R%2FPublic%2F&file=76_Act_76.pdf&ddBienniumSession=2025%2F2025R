12 SECTION 6. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
13 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
14 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
15 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
16 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
17 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
18 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
19 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
20 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
21 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
22 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
