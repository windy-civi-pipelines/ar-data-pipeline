1 SECTION 5. DO NOT CODIFY. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this act
2 are declared to be severable and the invalidity of any provision of this act
3 shall not affect other provisions of the act which can be given effect
4 without the invalid provision.
5
6 SECTION 6. DO NOT CODIFY. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and
7 determined by the General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that the process
8 for citizens to propose initiated acts and amendments to the Arkansas
9 Constitution is critical to a well-functioning democracy in this state; that
10 it is of the utmost importance that the integrity of the initiative process
11 be strengthened through this act so that petitioners and voters maintain a
12 high degree of confidence in the soundness of their right to legislate as
13 citizens of Arkansas; and that this act is immediately necessary because any
14 delay in the implementation of this act would disrupt the initiative process
15 for the 2026 general election, which would have a detrimental effect on the
16 public peace, health, and safety of Arkansas. Therefore, an emergency is
17 declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary for the
18 preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become effective
19 on:
20 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
21 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
22 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
23 bill; or
24 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
25 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
