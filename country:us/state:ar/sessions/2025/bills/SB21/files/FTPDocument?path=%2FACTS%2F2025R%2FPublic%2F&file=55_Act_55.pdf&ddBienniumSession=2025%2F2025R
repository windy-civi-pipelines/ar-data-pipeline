1 SECTION 4. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
2 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations

10 SECTION 5. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the General
11 Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits the
12 appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
13 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
14 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
15 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
16 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
17 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
18 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
19 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
20 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
