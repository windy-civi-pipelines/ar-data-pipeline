12 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
13 BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. Pay rates for physicians and chief psychologists
14 within the Division of Aging, Adult, and Behavioral Health Services may
15 include the special allowances available to UAMS physicians and professional
16 faculty as authorized in Arkansas Code. Part of the salaries of such staff
17 will come from the receipt of professional income in the care of patients
18 and/or funds received from federal agencies, foundations and other private
19 sponsors in the support of research. Provided that any such allowance shall
20 not exceed, for any employee, an amount equal to two and one half times the
21 salary authorized by the General Assembly. The specific Division of Aging,
22 Adult, and Behavioral Health Services classifications covered by this
23 language are:
24 Class
25 Code Title
26 L005N Psychiatric Specialist
27 L009N DHS Behavioral Health General Physician
28 L001C Psychologist Supervisor
29 Prior to these allowances being made available for an individual, they
30 will be approved by the Chief Fiscal Officer of the State and reviewed by the
31 Personnel Committee of the Arkansas Legislative Council or the Joint Budget
32 Committee.
33 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
34 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

As Engrossed: S3/17/25 S4/3/25 SB36
1 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. ARKANSAS
2 HEALTH CENTER. (A) The Department of Human Services shall not close the
3 Arkansas Health Center that provides skilled nursing through specialized
4 services and programs.
5 (B) The Department of Human Services shall continue to accept clients for
6 whom it has determined that skilled nursing and specialized services are
7 needed at the Arkansas Health Center.
8 (C) No funds shall be transferred or reduced from the Arkansas Health
9 Center, except for use as federal matching funds, below the approved funding
10 level on March 1, 2003 without the prior approval of the Arkansas Legislative
11 Council or the Joint Budget Committee.
12 (D) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue
13 funding for a state agency each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General
14 Assembly. This is usually accomplished by delineating such maximums in the
15 appropriation act(s) for a state agency and the general revenue allocations
16 authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue
17 Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the
18 Department of Human Services may operate more efficiently if some flexibility
19 is provided to the Department of Human Services authorizing broad powers
20 under this Section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the
21 General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the
22 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this section.
23 The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
24 Committee is not a severable part of this section. If the requirement of
25 approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is ruled
26 unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, this entire section is
27 void.
28 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
29 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.

20 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
21 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
22 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
23 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
24 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
25 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
26 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
27 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
28 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.

12 (D) Determining the maximum amount of appropriation and general revenue
13 funding for a state agency each fiscal year is the prerogative of the General
14 Assembly. This is usually accomplished by delineating such maximums in the
15 appropriation act(s) for a state agency and the general revenue allocations
16 authorized for each fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue
17 Stabilization law. Further, the General Assembly has determined that the
18 Department of Human Services may operate more efficiently if some flexibility
19 is provided to the Department of Human Services authorizing broad powers
20 under this Section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the
21 General Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the
22 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee as provided by this section.
23 The requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget

21 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
22 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
23 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
24 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
25 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
26 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
27 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
28 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
