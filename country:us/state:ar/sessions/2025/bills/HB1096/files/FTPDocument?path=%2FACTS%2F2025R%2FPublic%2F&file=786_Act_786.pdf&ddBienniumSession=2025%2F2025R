4
5 SECTION 7. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
6 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
7 POSITIONS. (a) Nothing in this act shall be construed as a commitment of the
8 State of Arkansas or any of its agencies or institutions to continue funding
9 any position paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement in the event
10 that Tobacco Settlement funds are not sufficient to finance the position.
11 (b) State funds will not be used to replace Tobacco Settlement funds when
12 such funds expire, unless appropriated by the General Assembly and authorized
13 by the Governor.
14 (c) A disclosure of the language contained in (a) and (b) of this Section
15 shall be made available to all new hire and current positions paid from the
16 proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement by the Tobacco Settlement Commission.
17 (d) Whenever applicable the information contained in (a) and (b) of this
18 Section shall be included in the employee handbook and/or Professional
19 Services Contract paid from the proceeds of the Tobacco Settlement.
20 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
21 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
22
23 SECTION 8. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
24 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFER
25 RESTRICTIONS. The appropriations provided in this act shall not be
26 transferred under the provisions of Arkansas Code 19-4-522, but only as
27 provided by this act.
28 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
29 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
30
31 SECTION 9. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
32 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW. TRANSFERS
33 OF APPROPRIATIONS. In the event the amount of any of the budget
34 classifications of maintenance and general operation in this act are found by
35 the administrative head of the agency to be inadequate, then the agency head
36 may request, upon forms provided for such purpose by the Chief Fiscal Officer
4 03-12-2025 15:38:19 LCW005

As Engrossed: H3/12/25 HB1096
1 of the State, a modification of the amounts of the budget classification. In
2 that event, he shall set out on the forms the particular classifications for
3 which he is requesting an increase or decrease, the amounts thereof, and his
4 reasons therefor. In no event shall the total amount of the budget exceed
5 either the amount of the appropriation or the amount of the funds available,
6 nor shall any transfer be made from the capital outlay or data processing
7 subclassifications unless specific authority for such transfers is provided
8 by law, except for transfers from capital outlay to data processing when
9 determined by the Division of Information Systems that data processing
10 services for a state agency can be performed on a more cost-efficient basis
11 by the Division of Information Systems than through the purchase of data
12 processing equipment by that state agency. In considering the proposed
13 modification as prepared and submitted by each state agency, the Chief Fiscal
14 Officer of the State shall make such studies as he deems necessary. The Chief
15 Fiscal Officer of the State shall, after obtaining the approval of the
16 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee, approve the requested transfer
17 if in his opinion it is in the best interest of the state.
18 Upon determination by the Secretary of the Department of Human Services
19 that a Reallocation of Resources is necessary for the effective operation of
20 the Medicaid Tobacco Settlement Program Grants, the Secretary, with the
21 approval of the Governor, shall have the authority to request from the Chief
22 Fiscal Officer of the State a transfer of Appropriation. This transfer
23 authority applies only to the Medicaid Tobacco Settlement Program Grants
24 appropriation section of this Act between the Hospital and Medical Services
25 line item and the Prescription Drugs line item. The limitation restrictions
26 applicable to the Department Reallocation of Resources authority applies to
27 this section.
28 The General Assembly has determined that the agency in this act could be
29 operated more efficiently if some flexibility is given to that agency and
30 that flexibility is being accomplished by providing authority to transfer
31 between certain items of appropriation made by this act. Since the General
32 Assembly has granted the agency broad powers under the transfer of
33 appropriations, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
34 Assembly maintain oversight of the utilization of the transfers by requiring
35 prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee in the
36 utilization of the transfer authority. Therefore, the requirement of approval
5 03-12-2025 15:38:19 LCW005

As Engrossed: H3/12/25 HB1096
1 by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part
2 of this section. If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or
3 Joint Budget Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent
4 jurisdiction, this entire section is void.
5 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
6 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
7
8 SECTION 10. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
9 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
10 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds authorized by this act
11 shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency and funds made
12 available by law for the support of such appropriations; and the restrictions
13 of the State Purchasing Law, the General Accounting and Budgetary Procedures
14 Law, the Regular Salary Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors,
15 and other fiscal control laws of this State, where applicable, and
16 regulations promulgated by the Department of Finance and Administration, as
17 authorized by law, shall be strictly complied with in disbursement of said
18 funds.
19 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
20 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
21
22 SECTION 11. SPECIAL LANGUAGE. NOT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE ARKANSAS
23 CODE NOR PUBLISHED SEPARATELY AS SPECIAL, LOCAL AND TEMPORARY LAW.
24 LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General Assembly that any funds
25 disbursed under the authority of the appropriations contained in this act
26 shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for which this act was
27 adopted, as evidenced by Initiated Act 1 of 2000, the Agency Requests,
28 Executive Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the
29 budget manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration,
30 letters, or summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas
31 Legislative Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and
32 adoption.
33 The provisions of this section shall be in effect only from July 1, 2024
34 2025 through June 30, 2025 2026.
35
36 SECTION 12. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
6 03-12-2025 15:38:19 LCW005

As Engrossed: H3/12/25 HB1096
1 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
2 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
3 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
4 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
5 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
6 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
7 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
8 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
9 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
10 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
