22 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of
23 appropriation and general revenue funding for a state agency each fiscal year

28 has determined that the Administrative Office of the Courts may operate more
29 efficiently if some flexibility is provided to the Administrative Office of
30 the Courts authorizing broad powers under this Section. Therefore, it is
31 both necessary and appropriate that the General Assembly maintain oversight
32 by requiring prior approval of the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
33 Committee as provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the

14 the State to transfer appropriation to the County Juror Reimbursement
15 appropriation and State Central Services funding in the same amount to the

21 for a state agency and the general revenue allocations authorized for each
22 fund and fund account by amendment to the Revenue Stabilization law.
23 Further, the General Assembly has determined that the Administrative Office
24 of the Courts may operate more efficiently if some flexibility is provided to
25 the Administrative Office of the Courts authorizing broad powers under this
26 Section. Therefore, it is both necessary and appropriate that the General
27 Assembly maintain oversight by requiring prior approval of the Legislative
28 Council or Joint Budget Committee, if meeting in a Legislative Session, as
29 provided by this section. The requirement of approval by the Legislative
30 Council or Joint Budget Committee is not a severable part of this section.
31 If the requirement of approval by the Legislative Council or Joint Budget
32 Committee is ruled unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction,
33 this entire section is void.

1 SECTION 41. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds
2 authorized by this act shall be limited to the appropriation for such agency
3 and funds made available by law for the support of such appropriations; and
4 the restrictions of the State Procurement Law, the General Accounting and
5 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
6 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
7 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
8 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be
9 strictly complied with in disbursement of said funds.
10
11 SECTION 42. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General
12 Assembly that any funds disbursed under the authority of the appropriations
13 contained in this act shall be in compliance with the stated reasons for
14 which this act was adopted, as evidenced by the Agency Requests, Executive
15 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
16 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
17 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative
18 Council or Joint Budget Committee which relate to its passage and adoption.
19
20 SECTION 43. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
21 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
22 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
23 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
24 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
25 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
26 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
27 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
28 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
29 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
30 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.

22 Determining the maximum number of employees and the maximum amount of

1 SECTION 41. COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS. Disbursement of funds

5 Budgetary Procedures Law, the Revenue Stabilization Law, the Regular Salary
6 Procedures and Restrictions Act, or their successors, and other fiscal
7 control laws of this State, where applicable, and regulations promulgated by
8 the Department of Finance and Administration, as authorized by law, shall be

11 SECTION 42. LEGISLATIVE INTENT. It is the intent of the General

15 Recommendations and Legislative Recommendations contained in the budget
16 manuals prepared by the Department of Finance and Administration, letters, or
17 summarized oral testimony in the official minutes of the Arkansas Legislative

19
20 SECTION 43. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
21 General Assembly, that the Constitution of the State of Arkansas prohibits
22 the appropriation of funds for more than a one (1) year period; that the
23 effectiveness of this Act on July 1, 2025 is essential to the operation of
24 the agency for which the appropriations in this Act are provided, and that in
25 the event of an extension of the legislative session, the delay in the
26 effective date of this Act beyond July 1, 2025 could work irreparable harm
27 upon the proper administration and provision of essential governmental
28 programs. Therefore, an emergency is hereby declared to exist and this Act
29 being necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
30 and safety shall be in full force and effect from and after July 1, 2025.
