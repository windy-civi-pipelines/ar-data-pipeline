HB1331
1 SECTION 2. EMERGENCY CLAUSE. It is found and determined by the
2 General Assembly of the State of Arkansas that when a county quorum court
3 does not pass an annual appropriation ordinance the county cannot provide
4 basic services and the county employees cannot be paid; that this act will
5 allow expenditures to be paid until an annual appropriation ordinance is in
6 place; that the lack of an appropriation ordinance makes it impossible for
7 the county to provide necessary services to the citizens of the county, which
8 threatens the public peace, health, and safety of the residents of the
9 county; and that this act is immediately necessary because failure to pass an
10 annual appropriation ordinance puts county employees in financial distress
11 and at risk of being unable to pay for financial responsibilities. Therefore,
12 an emergency is declared to exist, and this act being immediately necessary
13 for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety shall become
14 effective on:
15 (1) The date of its approval by the Governor;
16 (2) If the bill is neither approved nor vetoed by the Governor,
17 the expiration of the period of time during which the Governor may veto the
18 bill; or
19 (3) If the bill is vetoed by the Governor and the veto is
20 overridden, the date the last house overrides the veto.
